Tell me O Muse of the man of many devices who wandered so very much after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy 
Many were the men whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the sea seeking after his own life and the homecoming of his comrades
Yet even so he did not save his comrades though he struggled hard
for through their own blind folly they perishedfools who devoured the cattle of Helios Hyperion
And so he took from them the day of their homecoming
Of these things goddess daughter of Zeus beginning where you will tell also to us
Now all the rest as many as had escaped sheer destruction were at home having escaped from both war and sea
Odysseus alone filled with longing for his return and for his wife the queenly nymph Calypso that bright goddess kept back in her hollow caves yearning that he should be her husband
But when as the seasons revolved the year came in which the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca  not even there had he made his escape from toils even among his own people
The gods felt pity all except Poseidon
but he continued to rage unceasingly against godlike Odysseus until he reached his own land
Poseidon had however gone among the faroff Ethiopiansthe Ethiopians who dwell split in two the farthermost of men some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises there to receive a hecatomb of bulls and rams
and there he was taking his pleasure sitting at the feast
but the other gods were gathered together in the halls of Olympian Zeus
Among them the father of gods and men was first to speak
for in his heart he thought of blameless Aegisthus whom farfamed Orestes Agamemnons son had slain
Remembering him he spoke among the immortals
I cant believe how ridiculously ready mortals are to blame the gods
It is from us they say that evils come but they even themselves through their own blind folly have sorrows beyond that which is ordained So even now Aegisthus beyond that which was ordained took to himself the wedded wife of the son of Atreus and kkilled him on his homecoming although well he knew of sheer destruction seeing that we told him beforehand having sent Hermes the keensighted Argeiphontes 1 that he should neither slay the man nor woo his wife
for from Orestes shall come vengeance for the son of Atreus when once he has come to manhood and longs for his own land
So Hermes spoke but for all his good intent he did not persuade the heart of Aegisthus
and now he has paid the full price of all
Then the goddess flashingeyed 1 Athena answered him
Father of us all thou son of Cronos high above all lords aye verily that man lies low in a destruction that is his due
so too may any other also be destroyed who does such deeds
But my heart is torn for wise Odysseus hapless man who far from his friends has long been suffering woes in a seagirt isle where is the navel of the sea
Tis a wooded isle and therein dwells a goddess daughter of Atlas of baneful mind who knows the depths of every sea and himself holds the tall pillars which keep earth and heaven apart
His daughter it is that keeps back that wretched sorrowing man and ever with soft and wheedling words she beguiles him that he may forget Ithaca 
But Odysseus in his longing to see were it but the smoke leaping up from his own land yearns to die
Yet thy heart doth not regard it Olympian
Did not Odysseus beside the ships of the Argives offer thee sacrifice without stint in the broad land of Troy 
Wherefore then didst thou conceive such wrath 2 against him O Zeus
Then Zeus the cloudgatherer answered her and said
My child what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth
How should I then forget godlike Odysseus who is beyond all mortals in wisdom and beyond all has paid sacrifice to the immortal gods who hold broad heaven
Nay it is Poseidon the earthenfolder who is ever filled with stubborn wrath because of the Cyclops whom Odysseus blinded of his eye even the godlike Polyphemus whose might is greatest among all the Cyclopes
and the nymph Thoosa bore him daughter of Phorcys who rules over the unresting 1 sea for in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon
From that time forth Poseidon the earthshaker does not indeed slay Odysseus but makes him a wanderer from his native land
But come let us who are here all take thought of his return that he may come home
and Poseidon will let go his anger
for he will in no wise be able against all the immortal gods and in their despite to contend alone
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena answered him
Father of us all thou son of Cronos high above all lords if indeed this is now well pleasing to the blessed gods that the wise Odysseus should return to his own home let us send forth Hermes the messenger Argeiphontes to the isle Ogygia that with all speed he may declare to the fairtressed nymph our fixed resolve even the return of Odysseus of the steadfast heart that he may come home
But as for me I will go to Ithaca  that I may the more arouse his son and set courage in his heart to call to an assembly the longhaired Achaeans and speak out his word to all the wooers who are ever slaying his thronging sheep and his sleek 2 kine of shambling gait
And I will guide him to Sparta and to sandy Pylos  to seek tidings of the return of his dear father if haply he may hear of it that good report may be his among men
So she spoke and bound beneath her feet her beautiful sandals immortal 1 golden which were wont to bear her both over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind
And she took her mighty spear tipped with sharp bronze heavy and huge and strong wherewith she vanquishes the ranks of menof warriors with whom she is wroth she the daughter of the mighty sire
Then she went darting down from the heights of Olympus  and took her stand in the land of Ithaca at the outer gate of Odysseus on the threshold of the court
In her hand she held the spear of bronze and she was in the likeness of a stranger Mentes the leader of the Taphians
There she found the proud wooers
They were taking their pleasure at draughts in front of the doors sitting on the hides of oxen which they themselves had slain
and of the heralds 2 and busy squires some were mixing wine and water for them in bowls others again were washing the tables with porous sponges and setting them forth while still others were portioning out meats in abundance
Her the godlike Telemachus was far the first to see for he was sitting among the wooers sad at heart seeing in thought his noble father should he perchance come from somewhere and make a scattering of the wooers in the palace and himself win honor and rule over his own house
As he thought of these things sitting among the wooers he beheld Athena 
and he went straight to the outer door for in his heart he counted it shame that a stranger should stand long at the gates
So drawing near he clasped her right hand and took from her the spear of bronze and he spoke and addressed her with winged words 1
Hail stranger in our house thou shalt find entertainment
and then when thou hast tasted food thou shalt tell of what thou hast need
So saying he led the way and Pallas Athena followed
And when they were within the lofty house he bore the spear and set it against a tall pillar in a polished spearrack where were set many spears besides even those of Odysseus of the steadfast heart Athena herself he led and seated on a chair spreading a linen cloth beneatha beautiful chair richlywrought 2
and below was a footstool for the feet
Beside it he placed for himself an inlaid seat apart from the others the wooers lest the stranger vexed by their din should loathe the meal seeing that he was in the company of overweening men and also that he might ask him about his father that was gone
Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash
and beside them drew up a polished table
And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread and therewith dainties in abundance giving freely of her store
And a carver lifted up and placed before them platters of all manner of meats and set by them golden goblets
while a herald ever walked to and fro pouring them wine
Then in came the proud wooers
and thereafter sat them down in rows on chairs and high seats Heralds poured water over their hands and maidservants heaped by them bread in baskets and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink
and they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them
Now after the wooers had put from them the desire of food and drink their hearts turned to other things to song and to dance
for these things are the crown of a feast
And a herald put the beautiful lyre in the hands of Phemius who sang perforce among the wooers
and he struck the chords in prelude 1 to his sweet lay
But Telemachus spoke to flashingeyed Athena holding his head close that the others might not hear
Dear stranger wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say
These men care for things like these the lyre and song full easily seeing that without atonement they devour the livelihood of another of a man whose white bones it may be rot in the rain as they lie upon the mainland or the wave rolls them in the sea
Were they to see him returned to Ithaca  they would all pray to be swifter of foot rather than richer in gold and in raiment
But now he has thus perished by an evil doom nor for us is there any comfort no not though any one of men upon the earth should say that he will come
gone is the day of his returning
But come tell me this and declare it truly
Who art thou among men and from whence
Where is thy city and where thy parents
On what manner of ship didst thou come
and how did sailors bring thee to Ithaca 
Who did they declare themselves to be
For nowise methinks didst thou come hither on foot
And tell me this also truly that I may know full well whether this is thy first coming hither or whether thou art indeed a friend of my fathers house For many were the men who came to our house as strangers since he too had gone to and fro 1 among men
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena answered him
Therefore of a truth will I frankly tell thee all
I declare that I am Mentes the son of wise Anchialus and I am lord over the oarloving Taphians
And now have I put in here as thou seest with ship and crew while sailing over the winedark sea to men of strange speech on my way to Temese for copper and I bear with me shining iron
My ship lies yonder beside the fields away from the city in the harbor of Rheithron under woody Neion
Friends of one another do we declare ourselves to be even as our fathers were friends from of old Nay if thou wilt go and ask the old warrior Laertes who they say comes no more to the city but afar in the fields suffers woes attended by an aged woman as his handmaid who sets before him food and drink after weariness has laid hold of his limbs as he creeps along the slope of his vineyard plot
And now am I come
for of a truth men said that he thy father was among his people
but lo the gods are thwarting him of his return
For not yet has goodly Odysseus perished on the earth but still I ween he lives and is held back on the broad sea in a seagirt isle and cruel men keep him a savage folk that constrain him haply sore against his will
Nay I will now prophesy to thee as the immortals put it in my heart and as I think it shall be brought to pass though I am in no wise a soothsayer nor one versed in the signs of birds
Not much longer shall he be absent from his dear native land no not though bonds of iron hold him
He will contrive a way to return for he is a man of many devices
But come tell me this and declare it truly whether indeed tall as thou art thou art the son of Odysseus himself
Wondrously like his are thy head and beautiful eyes for full often did we consort with one another before he embarked for the land of Troy  whither others too the bravest of the Argives went in their hollow ships
But since that day neither have I seen Odysseus nor he me
Then wise Telemachus answered her
Therefore of a truth stranger will I frankly tell thee all
My mother says that I am his child but I know not
for never yet did any man of himself know his own parentage
Ah would that I had been the son of some blest man whom old age overtook among his own possessions
But now of him who was the most illfated of mortal men they say that I am sprung since thou askest me of this
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena answered him
Surely then no nameless lineage have the gods appointed for thee in time to come seeing that Penelope bore thee such as thou art
But come tell me this and declare it truly
What feast what throng is this
What need hast thou of it
Is it a drinking bout or a wedding feast
For this plainly is no meal to which each brings his portion
with such outrage and overweening do they seem to me to be feasting in thy halls
Angered would a man be at seeing all these shameful acts any man of sense who should come among them
Then wise Telemachus answered her
Stranger since indeed thou dost ask and question me of this our house once bade fair to be rich and honorable so long as that man was still among his people
But now the gods have willed otherwise in their evil devising seeing that they have caused him to pass from sight as they have no other man For I should not so grieve for his death if he had been slain among his comrades in the land of the Trojans or had died in the arms of his friends when he had wound up the skein of war
Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb and for his son too he would have won great glory in days to come
But as it is the spirits of the storm 1 have swept him away and left no tidings
he is gone out of sight out of hearing and for me he has left anguish and weeping
nor do I in any wise mourn and wail for him alone seeing that the gods have brought upon me other sore troubles
For all the princes who hold sway over the islandsDulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthusand those who lord it over rocky Ithaca  all these woo my mother and lay waste my house
And she neither refuses the hateful marriage nor is she able to make an end
but they with feasting consume my substance
ere long they will bring me too to ruin
Then stirred to anger Pallas Athena spoke to him
Out on it Thou hast of a truth sore need of Odysseus that is gone that he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers
Would that he might come now and take his stand at the outer gate of the house with helmet and shield and two spears such a man as he was when I first saw him in our house drinking and making merry on his way back from Ephyre from the house of Ilus son of Mermerus For thither too went Odysseus in his swift ship in search of a deadly drug that he might have wherewith to smear his bronzetipped arrows
yet Ilus gave it not to him for he stood in awe of the gods that are forever but my father gave it
for he held him strangely dear Would I say that in such strength Odysseus might come amongst the wooers
then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing
Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods whether he shall return and wreak vengeance in his halls or whether he shall not
but for thyself I bid thee take thought how thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the hall
Come now give ear and hearken to my words
On the morrow call to an assembly the Achaean lords and speak out thy word to all and let the gods be thy witnesses
As for the wooers bid them scatter each to his own and for thy mother if her heart bids her marry let her go back to the hall of her mighty father
and there they will prepare a wedding feast and make ready the gifts 1 full manyaye all that should follow after a wellloved daughter
And to thyself will I give wise counsel if thou wilt hearken
Man with twenty rowers the best ship thou hast and go to seek tidings of thy father that has long been gone if haply any mortal may tell thee or thou mayest hear a voice from Zeus which oftenest brings tidings to men
First go to Pylos and question goodly Nestor and from thence to Sparta to fairhaired Menelaus
for he was the last to reach home of the brazencoated Achaeans
If so be thou shalt hear that thy father is alive and coming home then verily though thou art sore afflicted thou couldst endure for yet a year
But if thou shalt hear that he is dead and gone then return to thy dear native land and heap up a mound for him and over it pay funeral rites full many as is due and give thy mother to a husband
Then when thou hast done all this and brought it to an end thereafter take thought in mind and heart how thou mayest slay the wooers in thy halls whether by guile or openly
for it beseems thee not to practise childish ways since thou art no longer of such an age
Or hast thou not heard what fame the goodly Orestes won among all mankind when he slew his fathers murderer the guileful Aegisthus for that he slew his glorious father
Thou too my friend for I see that thou art comely and tall be thou valiant that many an one of men yet to be born may praise thee
But now I will go down to my swift ship and my comrades who methinks are chafing much at waiting for me
For thyself give heed and have regard to my words
Then wise Telemachus answered her
Stranger in truth thou speakest these things with kindly thought as a father to his son and never will I forget them
But come now tarry eager though thou art to be gone in order that when thou hast bathed and satisfied thy heart to the full thou mayest go to thy ship glad in spirit and bearing a gift costly and very beautiful which shall be to thee an heirloom from me even such a gift as dear friends give to friends
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena answered him
Stay me now no longer when I am eager to be gone
and whatsoever gift thy heart bids thee give me give it when I come back to bear to my home choosing a right beautiful one
it shall bring thee its worth in return
So spoke the goddess flashingeyed Athena and departed flying upward 1 as a bird
and in his heart she put strength and courage and made him think of his father even more than aforetime
And in his mind he marked her and marvelled
for he deemed that she was a god
and straightway he went among the wooers a godlike man
For them the famous minstrel was singing and they sat in silence listening
and he sang of the return of the Achaeansthe woeful return from Troy which Pallas Athena laid upon them
And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius wise Penelope heard his wondrous song
and she went down the high stairway from her chamber not alone for two handmaids attended her
Now when the fair lady had come to the wooers she stood by the doorpost of the wellbuilt hall holding before her face her shining veil
and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her
Then she burst into tears and spoke to the divine minstrel
Phemius many other things thou knowest to charm mortals deeds of men and gods which minstrels make famous
Sing them one of these as thou sittest here and let them drink their wine in silence
But cease from this woeful song which ever harrows the heart in my breast for upon me above all women has come a sorrow not to be forgotten
So dear a head do I ever remember with longing even my husband whose fame is wide through Hellas and mid Argos  1
Then wise Telemachus answered her
My mother why dost thou begrudge the good minstrel to give pleasure in whatever way his heart is moved
It is not minstrels that are to blame but Zeus I ween is to blame who gives to men that live by toil 2 to each one as he will
With this man no one can be wroth if he sings of the evil doom of the Danaans
for men praise that song the most which comes the newest to their ears
For thyself let thy heart and soul endure to listen
for not Odysseus alone lost in Troy the day of his return but many others likewise perished
Nay go to thy chamber and busy thyself with thine own tasks the loom and the distaff and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks
but speech shall be for men for all but most of all for me
since mine is the authority in the house
She then seized with wonder went back to her chamber
for she laid to heart the wise saying of her son
Up to her upper chamber she went with her handmaids and then bewailed Odysseus her dear husband until flashingeyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids
But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls and all prayed each that he might lie by her side
And among them wise Telemachus was the first to speak
Wooers of my mother overweening in your insolence for the present let us make merry with feasting but let there be no brawling for this is a goodly thing to listen to a minstrel such as this man is like to the gods in voice
But in the morning let us go to the assembly and take our seats one and all that I may declare my word to you outright that you depart from these halls
Prepare you other feasts eating your own substance and changing from house to house
But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing that one mans livelihood should be ruined without atonement waste ye it
But I will call upon the gods that are forever if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought
Without atonement then should ye perish within my halls
So he spoke and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus for that he spoke boldly
Then Antinous son of Eupeithes answered him
Telemachus verily the gods themselves are teaching thee to be a man of vaunting tongue and to speak with boldness
May the son of Cronos never make thee king in seagirt Ithaca  which thing is by birth thy heritage
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Antinous wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say
Even this should I be glad to accept from the hand of Zeus
Thinkest thou indeed that this is the worst fate among men
Nay it is no bad thing to be a king
Straightway ones house grows rich and oneself is held in greater honor
However there are other kings of the Achaeans full many in seagirt Ithaca  both young and old One of these haply may have this place since goodly Odysseus is dead
But I will be lord of our own house and of the slaves that goodly Odysseus won for me
Then Eurymachus son of Polybus answered him
Telemachus this matter verily lies on the knees of the gods who of the Achaeans shall be king in seagirt Ithaca 
but as for thy possessions thou mayest keep them thyself and be lord in thine own house
Never may that man come who by violence and against thy will shall wrest thy possessions from thee while men yet live in Ithaca 
But I am fain good sir to ask thee of the stranger whence this man comes Of what land does he declare himself to be Where are his kinsmen and his native fields
Does he bring some tidings of thy fathers coming or came he hither in furtherance of some matter of his own
How he started up and was straightway gone Nor did he wait to be known
and yet he seemed no base man to look upon
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Eurymachus surely my fathers homecoming is lost and gone
No longer do I put trust in tidings whencesoever they may come nor reck I of any prophecy which my mother haply may learn of a seer when she has called him to the hall
But this stranger is a friend of my fathers house from Taphos He declares that he is Mentes son of wise Anchialus and he is lord over the oarloving Taphians
So spoke Telemachus but in his heart he knew the immortal goddess
Now the wooers turned to the dance and to gladsome song and made them merry and waited till evening should come
and as they made merry dark evening came upon them
Then they went each man to his house to take their rest
But Telemachus where his chamber was built in the beautiful court high in a place of wide outlook thither went to his bed pondering many things in mind
and with him bearing blazing torches went truehearted Eurycleia daughter of Ops son of Peisenor Her long ago Laertes had bought with his wealth when she was in her first youth and gave for her the price of twenty oxen and he honored her even as he honored his faithful wife in his halls but he never lay with her in love for he shunned the wrath of his wife
She it was who bore for Telemachus the blazing torches for she of all the handmaids loved him most and had nursed him when he was a child
He opened the doors of the wellbuilt chamber sat down on the bed and took off his soft tunic
and laid it in the wise old womans hands
And she folded and smoothed the tunic and hung it on a peg beside the corded 1 bedstead and then went forth from the chamber drawing the door to by its silver handle and driving the bolt home with the thong
So there the night through wrapped in a fleece of wool he pondered in his mind upon the journey which Athena had shewn him
Soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered up from his bed arose the dear son of Odysseus and put on his clothing About his shoulder he slung his sharp sword and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals and went forth from his chamber like a god to look upon
Straightway he bade the clearvoiced heralds to summon to the assembly the longhaired Achaeans
And the heralds made the summons and the Achaeans assembled full quickly
Now when they were assembled and met together Telemachus went his way to the place of assembly holding in his hand a spear of bronzenot alone for along with him two swift hounds followed
and wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him
and all the people marvelled at him as he came
But he sat down in his fathers seat and the elders gave place
Then among them the lord Aegyptius was the first to speak a man bowed with age and wise with wisdom untold
Now he spoke because his dear son had gone in the hollow ships to Ilius famed for its horses in the company of godlike Odysseus even the warrior Antiphus
But him the savage Cyclops had slain in his hollow cave and made of him his latest meal
Three others there were one Eurynomus consorted with the wooers and two ever kept their fathers farm
Yet even so he could not forget that other
mourning and sorrowing and weeping for him he addressed the assembly and spoke among them
Hearken now to me men of Ithaca  to the word that I shall say
Never have we held assembly or session since the day when goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships
And now who has called us together
On whom has such need come either of the young men or of those who are older
Has he heard some tidings of the armys return 1 which he might tell us plainly seeing that he has first learned of it himself
Or is there some other public matter on which he is to speak and address us
A good man he seems in my eyes a blessed man
May Zeus fulfil unto him himself some good even whatsoever he desires in his heart
So he spoke and the dear son of Odysseus rejoiced at the word of omen nor did he thereafter remain seated but was fain to speak So he took his stand in the midst of the assembly
and the staff was placed in his hands by the herald Peisenor wise in counsel
Then he spoke addressing first the old man
Old man not far off as thou shalt soon learn thyself is that man who has called the host togethereven I
for on me above all others has sorrow come
I have neither heard any tidings of the armys return which I might tell you plainly seeing that I had first learned of it myself nor is there any other public matter on which I am to speak and address you Nay it is mine own need for that evil has fallen upon my house in twofold wise
First I have lost my noble sire who was once king among you here and was gentle as a father
and now there is come an evil yet greater far which will presently altogether destroy my house and ruin all my livelihood
My mother have wooers beset against her will the sons of those men who are here the noblest They shrink from going to the house of her father Icarius that he may himself exact the bridegifts for his daughter and give her to whom he will even to him who meets his favour
but thronging our house day after day they slay our oxen and sheep and fat goats and keep revel and drink the sparkling wine recklessly
and havoc is made of all this wealth
For there is no man here such as Odysseus was to ward off ruin from the house
As for me I am nowise such as he to ward it off
Nay verily even if I try I shall be found a weakling and one knowing naught of valor
Yet truly I would defend myself if I had but the power
for now deeds past all enduring have been wrought and past all that is seemly has my house been destroyed
Take shame upon yourselves and have regard to your neighbors who dwell roundabout
and fear the wrath of the gods lest haply they turn against you in anger at your evil deeds 1
I pray you by Olympian Zeus and by Themis who looses and gathers the assemblies of men
forbear my friends 2 and leave me alone to pine in bitter griefunless indeed my father goodly Odysseus despitefully wrought the wellgreaved Achaeans woe in requital whereof ye work me woe despitefully by urging these men on
For me it were better that ye should yourselves eat up my treasures and my flocks
If ye were to devour them recompense would haply be made some day
for just so long should we go up and down the city pressing our suit and asking back our goods until all was given back
But now past cure are the woes ye put upon my heart
Thus he spoke in wrath and dashed the staff down upon the ground bursting into tears
and pity fell upon all the people
Then all the others kept silent and no man had the heart to answer Telemachus with angry words
Antinous alone answered him and said
Telemachus thou braggart unrestrained in daring what a thing hast thou said putting us to shame
and wouldest fain fasten reproach upon us
Nay I tell thee it is not the Achaean wooers who are anywise at fault but thine own mother for she is crafty above all women
For it is now the third year and the fourth will soon pass 1 since she has been deceiving the hearts of the Achaeans in their breasts
To all she offers hopes and has promises for each man sending them messages
but her mind is set on other things
And she devised in her heart this guileful thing also she set up in her halls a great web and fell to weaving fine of thread was the web and very wide
and straightway she spoke among us
Young men my wooers since goodly Odysseus is dead be patient though eager for my marriage until I finish this robeI would not that my spinning should come to naughta shroud for the lord Laertes against the time when the fell fate of grievous 2 death shall strike him down lest any of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth with me
if he who had won great possessions were to lie without a shroud
So she spoke and our proud hearts consented
Then day by day she would weave at the great web but by night would unravel it when she had let place torches by her
Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing and beguiled them
but when the fourth year came as the seasons rolled on even then one of her women who knew all told us and we caught her unravelling the splendid web
So she finished it against her will perforce
Therefore to thee the wooers make answer thus that thou mayest thyself know it in thine heart and that all the Achaeans may know
Send away thy mother and command her to wed whomsoever her father bids and whoso is pleasing to her
But if she shall continue long time to vex the sons of the Achaeans mindful in her heart of this that Athena has endowed her above other women with knowledge of fair handiwork and an understanding heart and wiles such as we have never yet heard that any even of the women of old knew of those who long ago were fairtressed Achaean women Tyro and Alcmene and Mycene of the fair crown
of whom not one was like Penelope in shrewd device
yet this at least she devised not aright
For so long shall men devour thy livelihood and thy possessions even as long as she shall keep the counsel which the gods now put in her heart
Great fame she brings on herself but on thee regret for thy much substance
For us we will go neither to our lands nor else whither until she marries that one of the Achaeans whom she will
Then wise Telemachus answered him and said
Antinous in no wise may I thrust forth from the house against her will her that bore me and reared me
and as for my father he is in some other land whether he be alive or dead
An evil thing it were for me to pay back a great price to Icarius as I must if of my own will I send my mother away
For from her fathers hand shall I suffer evil and heaven will send other ills besides for my mother as she leaves the house will invoke the dread Avengers
and I shall have blame too from men
Therefore will I never speak this word
And for you if your own heart is wroth here at get you forth from my halls and prepare you other feasts eating your own substance and changing from house to house
But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing that one mans livelihood should be ruined without atonement waste ye it
But I will call upon the gods that are forever if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought
Without atonement then should ye perish within my halls
So spoke Telemachus and in answer Zeus whose voice is borne afar 1 sent forth two eagles flying from on high from a mountain peak
For a time they flew swift as the blasts of the wind side by side with wings outspread
but when they reached the middle of the manyvoiced assembly then they wheeled about flapping their wings rapidly and down on the heads of all they looked and death was in their glare
Then they tore with their talons one anothers cheeks and necks on either side and darted away to the right across the houses and the city of the men
But they were seized with wonder at the birds when their eyes beheld them
and pondered in their hearts on what was to come to pass
Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses son of Mastor
for he surpassed all men of his day in knowledge of birds and in uttering words of fate
He with good intent addressed their assembly and spoke among them
Hearken now to me men of Ithaca  to the word that I shall say
and to the wooers especially do I declare and announce these things
since on them a great woe is rolling
For Odysseus shall not long be away from his friends but even now methinks he is near and is sowing death and fate for these men one and all
Aye and to many others of us also who dwell in clearseen Ithaca will he be a bane
But long ere that let us take thought how we may make an end of this
or rather let them of themselves make an end
for this is straightway the better course for them
Not as one untried do I prophesy but with sure knowledge
For unto Odysseus I declare that all things are fulfilled even as I told him when the Argives embarked for Ilios and with them went Odysseus of many wiles
I declared that after suffering many ills and losing all his comrades he would come home in the twentieth year unknown to all
and lo all this is now being brought to pass
Then Eurymachus son of Polybus answered him and said
Old man up now get thee home and prophesy to thy children lest haply in days to come they suffer ill
In this matter I am better far than thou to prophesy
Many birds there are that fare to and fro under the rays of the sun and not all are fateful
As for Odysseus he has perished far away as I would that thou hadst likewise perished with him
Then wouldst thou not prate so much in thy reading of signs or be urging Telemachus on in his wrath hoping for some gift for thy house if haply he shall give it
But I will speak out to thee and this word shall verily be brought to pass
If thou wise in the wisdom of old shalt beguile with thy talk a younger man and set him on to be wroth for him in the first place it shall be the more grievous and he will in no case be able to do aught because of these men here
and on thee old man will we lay a fine which it will grieve thy soul to pay
and bitter shall be thy sorrow
And to Telemachus I myself here among all will offer this counsel
His mother let him bid to go back to the house of her father
and they will prepare a wedding feast and make ready the gifts full manyaye all that should follow after a wellloved daughter
For ere that methinks the sons of the Achaeans will not cease from their grievous wooing since in any case we fear no man no not Telemachus for all his many wordsnor do we reck of any soothsaying which thou old man mayest declare it will fail of fulfillment and thou shalt be hated the more
Aye and his possessions shall be devoured in evil wise nor shall requital ever be made so long as she shall put off the Achaeans in the matter of her marriage
And we on our part waiting here day after day are rivals by reason of her excellence and go not after other women whom each one might fitly wed
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Eurymachus and all ye other lordly wooers in this matter I entreat you no longer nor speak thereof
for now the gods know it and all the Achaeans
But come give me a swift ship and twenty comrades who will accomplish my journey for me to and fro
For I shall go to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of the return of my father that has long been gone if haply any mortal man may tell me or I may hear a voice from Zeus which oftenest brings tidings to men
If so be I shall hear that my father is alive and coming home then verily though I am sore afflicted I could endure for yet a year
But if I shall hear that he is dead and gone then I will return to my dear native land and heap up a mound for him and over it pay funeral rites full many as is due and give my mother to a husband
So saying he sat down and among them rose Mentor who was a comrade of noble Odysseus To him on departing with his ships Odysseus had given all his house in charge that it should obey the old man and that he should keep all things safe
He with good intent addressed their assembly and spoke among them
Hearken now to me men of Ithaca  to the word that I shall say
Never henceforth let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle nor let him heed righteousness in his heart but let him ever be harsh and work unrighteousness
seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was yet gentle was he as a father
But of a truth I begrudge not the proud wooers that they work deeds of violence in the evil contrivings of their minds
for it is at the hazard of their own lives that they violently devour the house of Odysseus who they say will no more return
Nay rather it is with the rest of the folk that I am wroth that ye all sit thus in silence and utter no word of rebuke to make the wooers cease though ye are many and they but few
Then Leocritus son of Euenor answered him
Mentor thou mischiefmaker 1 thou wanderer in thy wits what hast thou said bidding men make us cease
Nay it were a hard thing to fight about a feast with men that moreover outnumber you
For if Ithacan Odysseus himself were to come and be eager at heart to drive out from his hall the lordly wooers who are feasting in his house then should his wife have no joy at his coming though sorely she longed for him but right here would he meet a shameful death if he fought with men that outnumbered him 2
Thou hast not spoken aright
But come now ye people scatter each one of you to his own lands As for this fellow Mentor and Halitherses will speed his journey for they are friends of his fathers house from of old
But methinks he will long abide here and get his tidings in Ithaca  and never accomplish this journey
So he spoke and hastily broke up the assembly
They then scattered each one to his own house and the wooers went to the house of divine Odysseus
But Telemachus went apart to the shore of the sea and having washed his hands in the grey seawater prayed to Athena
Hear me thou who didst come yesterday as a god to our house and didst bid me go in a ship over the misty deep to seek tidings of the return of my father that has long been gone
Lo all this the Achaeans hinder but the wooers most of all in their evil insolence
So he spoke in prayer and Athena drew near to him in the likeness of Mentor both in form and invoice and she spoke and addressed him with winged words
Telemachus neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless if aught of thy fathers goodly spirit has been instilled into thee such a man was he to fulfil both deed and word
So then shall this journey of thine be neither vain nor unfulfilled
But if thou art not the son of him and of Penelope then I have no hope that thou wilt accomplish thy desire
Few sons indeed are like their fathers most are worse few better than their fathers
But since neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless nor has the wisdom of Odysseus wholly failed thee there is therefore hope that thou wilt accomplish this work
Now then let be the will and counsel of the wooersfools for they are in no wise either prudent or just
nor do they know aught of death or black fate which verily is near at hand for them that they shall all perish in a day
But for thyself the journey on which thy heart is set shall not be long delayed
so true a friend of thy fathers house am I who will equip for thee a swift ship and myself go with thee
But go thou now to the house and join the company of the wooers make ready stores and bestow all in vessels wine in jars and barley meal the marrow of men in stout skins
but I going through the town will quickly gather comrades that go willingly
And ships there are full many in seagirt Ithaca  both new and old
of these will I choose out for thee the one that is best and quickly will we make her ready and launch her on the broad deep
So spoke Athena daughter of Zeus
nor did Telemachus tarry long after he had heard the voice of the goddess but went his way to the house his heart heavy within him
He found there the proud wooers in the halls flaying goats and singeing swine in the court
And Antinous with a laugh came straight to Telemachus and clasped his hand and spoke and addressed 1 him
Telemachus thou braggart unrestrained in daring let no more any evil deed or word be in thy heart Nay I bid thee eat and drink even as before
All these things the Achaeans will surely provide for theethe ship and chosen oarsmenthat with speed thou mayest go to sacred Pylos to seek for tidings of thy noble father
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Antinous in no wise is it possible for me in your overweening company to sit at meat quietly and to make merry with an easy mind
Is it not enough ye wooers that in time past ye wasted many goodly possessions of mine while I was still a child
But now that I am grown and gain knowledge by hearing the words of others yea and my spirit waxes within me I will try how I may hurl forth upon your evil fates either going to Pylos or here in this land
For go I will nor shall the journey be in vain whereof I speak
though I voyage in anothers ship since I may not be master of ship or oarsmen
So I ween it seemed to you to be more to your profit
He spoke and snatched his hand from the hand of Antinous without more ado
and the wooers were busy with the feast throughout the hall
They mocked and jeered at him in their talk
and thus would one of the proud youths speak
Aye verily Telemachus is planning our murder
He will bring men to aid him from sandy Pylos or even from Sparta  so terribly is he set upon it
Or he means to go to Ephyre that rich land to bring from thence deadly drugs that he may cast them in the winebowl and destroy us all
And again another of the proud youths would say
Who knows but he himself as he goes on the hollow ship may perish wandering far from his friends even as Odysseus did
So would he cause us yet more labour
for we should have to divide all his possessions and his house we should give to his mother to possess and to him who should wed her
So they spoke but Telemachus went down to the highroofed treasurechamber of his father a wide room where gold and bronze lay piled and raiment in chests and stores of fragrant oil
There too stood great jars of wine old and sweet holding within them an unmixed divine drink and ranged in order along the wall if ever Odysseus should return home even after many grievous toils
Shut were the double doors closefitted
and there both night and day a stewardess abode who guarded all in wisdom of mind Eurycleia daughter of Ops son of Peisenor
To her now Telemachus when he had called her to the treasurechamber spoke and said
Nurse draw me off wine in jars sweet wine that is the choicest next to that which thou guardest ever thinking upon that illfated one if haply Zeusborn Odysseus may come I know not whence having escaped from death and the fates
Fill twelve jars and fit them all with covers
and pour me barley meal into wellsewn skins
and let there be twenty measures of ground barley meal
But keep knowledge hereof to thyself
and have all these things brought together
for at evening I will fetch them when my mother goes to her upper chamber and bethinks her of her rest
For I am going to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of the return of my dear father if haply I may hear any
So he spoke and the dear nurse Eurycleia uttered a shrill cry and weeping spoke to him winged words
Ah dear child how has this thought come into thy mind 
Whither art thou minded to go over the wide earth thou who art an only son and wellbeloved
But he hath perished far from his country the Zeusborn Odysseus in a strange land
and these men so soon as thou art gone will devise evil for thee hereafter that thou mayest perish by guile and themselves divide all these possessions
Nay abide here in charge of what is thine
thou hast no need to suffer ills and go a wanderer over the unresting sea
Then wise Telemachus answered her
Take heart nurse for not without a gods warrant is this my plan
But swear to tell naught of this to my dear mother until the eleventh or twelfth day shall come or until she shall herself miss me and hear that I am gone that she may not mar her fair flesh with weeping
So he spoke and the old woman swore a great oath by the gods to say naught
But when she had sworn and made an end of the oath straightway she drew for him wine in jars and poured barley meal into wellsewn skins
and Telemachus went to the hall and joined the company of the wooers
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena took other counsel
In the likeness of Telemachus she went everywhere throughout the city and to each of the men she drew near and spoke her word bidding them gather at even beside the swift ship
Furthermore of Noemon the glorious son of Phronius she asked a swift ship
and he promised it to her with a ready heart
Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark Then she drew the swift ship to the sea and put in it all the gear that wellbenched ships carry
And she moored it at the mouth of the harbor and round about it the goodly company was gathered together
and the goddess heartened each man
Then again the goddess flashingeyed Athena took other counsel
She went her way to the house of divine Odysseus
and there began to shed sweet sleep upon the wooers and made them to wander in their drinking and from their hands she cast the cups
But they rose to go to their rest throughout the city and remained no long time seated for sleep was falling upon their eyelids
But to Telemachus spoke flashingeyed Athena calling him forth before the stately hall having likened herself to Mentor both in form and in voice
Telemachus already thy wellgreaved comrades sit at the oar and await thy setting out
Come let us go that we may not long delay their journey
So saying Pallas Athena led the way quickly
and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess
Now when they had come down to the ship and to the sea they found on the shore their longhaired comrades and the strong and mighty 1
Telemachus spoke among them
Come friends let us fetch the stores
for all are now gathered together in the hall
My mother knows naught hereof nor the handmaids either one only heard my word
Thus saying he led the way and they went along with him
So they brought and stowed everything in the wellbenched ship as the dear son of Odysseus bade
Then on board the ship stepped Telemachus and Athena went before him and sat down in the stern of the ship
and near her sat Telemachus
while the men loosed the stern cables and themselves stepped on board and sat down upon the benches
And flashingeyed Athena sent them a favorable wind a strongblowing West wind that sang over the winedark sea
And Telemachus called to his men and bade them lay hold of the tackling
and they hearkened to his call
The mast of fir they raised and set in the hollow socket and made it fast with forestays and hauled up the white sail with twisted thongs of oxhide
So the wind filled the belly of the sail and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship as she went
and she sped over the wave accomplishing her way
Then when they had made the tackling fast in the swift black ship they set forth bowls brim full of wine and poured libations to the immortal gods that are forever and chiefest of all to the flashingeyed daughter of Zeus
And now the sun leaving the beauteous mere sprang up into the brazen heaven to give light to the immortals and to mortal men on the earth the giver of grain
and they came to Pylos  the wellbuilt citadel of Neleus
Here the townsfolk on the shore of the sea were offering sacrifice of black bulls to the darkhaired Earthshaker
Nine companies there were and five hundred men sat in each and in each they held nine bulls ready for sacrifice
Now when they had tasted the inner parts and were burning the thighpieces to the god the others put straight in to the shore and hauled up and furled the sail of the shapely ship and moored her and themselves stepped forth
Forth too from the ship stepped Telemachus and Athena led the way
And the goddess flashingeyed Athena spake first to him and said
Telemachus no longer hast thou need to feel shame no not a whit
For to this end hast thou sailed over the sea that thou mightest seek tidings of thy fatherwhere the earth covered him and what fate he met
But come now go straightway to Nestor tamer of horses
let us learn what counsel he keepeth hid in his breast
And do thou beseech him thyself that he may tell thee the very truth
A lie will he not utter
for he is wise indeed
Then wise Telemachus answered her
Mentor how shall I go
Mentor and how shall I greet him
I am as yet all unversed in subtle speech
Mentor and moreover a young man has shame to question an elder
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena answered him
Telemachus somewhat thou wilt of thyself devise in thy breast and somewhat heaven too will prompt thee
For methinks not without the favour of the gods hast thou been born and reared
So spake Pallas Athena and led the way quickly
but he followed in the footsteps of the goddess
and they came to the gathering and the companies of the men of Pylos  There Nestor sat with his sons and round about his people making ready the feast were roasting some of the meat and putting other pieces on spits
But when they saw the strangers they all came thronging about them and clasped their hands in welcome and bade them sit down
First Nestors son Peisistratus came near and took both by the hand and made them to sit down at the feast on soft fleeces upon the sand of the sea beside his brother Thrasymedes and his father
Thereupon he gave them portions of the inner meat and poured wine in a golden cup
and pledging her he spoke to Pallas Athena daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis
Pray now stranger to the lord Poseidon
for his is the feast whereon you have chanced in coming hither
And when thou hast poured libations and hast prayed as is fitting then give thy friend also the cup of honeysweet wine that he may pour since he too I ween prays to the immortals
for all men have need of the gods
Howbeit he is the younger of like age with myself
wherefore to thee first will I give the golden cup
So he spake and placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine
But Pallas Athena rejoiced at the mans wisdom and judgment in that to her first he gave the golden cup
and straightway she prayed earnestly to the lord Poseidon
Hear me Poseidon thou Earthenfolder and grudge not in answer to our prayer to bring these deeds to fulfillment
To Nestor first of all and to his sons vouchsafe renown and then do thou grant to the rest gracious requital for this glorious hecatomb even to all the men of Pylos 
and grant furthermore that Telemachus and I may return when we have accomplished all that for which we came hither with our swift black ship
Thus she prayed and was herself fulfilling all
Then she gave Telemachus the fair twohandled 1 cup
and in like manner the dear son of Odysseus prayed
Then when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  2 spoke first among them
Now verily is it seemlier to ask and enquire of the strangers who they are since now they have had their joy of food
Strangers who are ye
Whence do ye sail over the watery ways
Is it on some business or do ye wander at random over the sea even as pirates who wander hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands
Then wise Telemachus took courage and made answer
for Athena herself put courage in his heart that he might ask about his father that was gone and that good report might be his among men
Nestor son of Neleus great glory of the Achaeans thou askest whence we are
and I will surely tell thee
We have come from Ithaca that is below Neion
but this business whereof I speak is mine own and concerns not the people
I come after the widespread rumor of my father if haply I may hear of it even of goodly Odysseus of the steadfast heart who once men say fought by thy side and sacked the city of the Trojans
For of all men else as many as warred with the Trojans we learn where each man died a woeful death but of him the son of Cronos has made even the death to be past learning
for no man can tell surely where he hath died whether he was overcome by foes on the mainland or on the deep among the waves of Amphitrite
Therefore am I now come to thy knees if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his woeful death whether thou sawest it haply with thine own eyes or didst hear from some other the story of his wanderings 1
for beyond all men did his mother bear him to sorrow
And do thou nowise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him
I beseech thee if ever my father noble Odysseus promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it in the land of the Trojans where you Achaeans suffered woes be mindful of it now I pray thee and tell me the very truth
Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  answered him
My friend since thou hast recalled to my mind the sorrow which we endured in that land we sons of the Achaeans unrestrained in daring all that we endured on shipboard as we roamed after booty over the misty deep whithersoever Achilles led and all our fightings around the great city of king Priam
lo there all our best were slain
There lies warlike Aias there Achilles there Patroclus the peer of the gods in counsel and there my own dear son strong alike and peerless Antilochus preeminent in speed of foot and as a warrior
Aye and many other ills we suffered besides these
who of mortal men could tell them all
Nay if for five years space or six years space thou wert to abide here and ask of all the woes which the goodly Achaeans endured there
thou wouldest grow weary ere the end and get thee back to thy native land
For nine years space were we busied plotting their ruin with all manner of wiles and hardly did the son of Cronos bring it to pass
There no man ventured to vie with him in counsel since goodly Odysseus far excelled in all manner of wilesthy father if indeed thou art his son
Amazement holds me as I look on thee
for verily thy speech is like his nor would one think that a younger man would speak so like him
Now all the time that we were there goodly Odysseus and I never spoke at variance either in the assembly or in the council but being of one mind advised the Argives with wisdom and shrewd counsel how all might be for the best
But when we had sacked the lofty city of Priam and had gone away in our ships and a god had scattered the Achaeans then even then Zeus planned in his heart a woeful return for the Argives for in no wise prudent or just were all
Wherefore many of them met an evil fate through the fell wrath of the flashingeyed goddess the daughter of the mighty sire
for she caused strife between the two sons of Atreus
Now these two called to an assembly all the Achaeans recklessly and in no due order at set of sunand they came heavy with wine the sons of the Achaeans and they spoke their word and told wherefore they had gathered the host together
Then in truth Menelaus bade all the Achaeans think of their return over the broad back of the sea but in no wise did he please Agamemnon
for he was fain to hold back the host and to offer holy hecatombs that he might appease the dread wrath of Athenafool nor knew he this that with her was to be no hearkening
for the mind of the gods that are forever is not quickly turned
So these two stood bandying harsh words
but the wellgreaved Achaeans sprang up with a wondrous din and twofold plans found favour with them
That night we rested each side pondering hard thoughts against the other
for Zeus was bringing upon us an evil doom
but in the morning some of us launched our ships upon the bright sea and put on board our goods and the lowgirdled women
Half indeed of the host held back and remained there with Agamemnon son of Atreus shepherd of the host
but half of us embarked and rowed away
and swiftly the ships sailed for a god made smooth the cavernous sea
But when we came to Tenedos  we offered sacrifice to the gods being eager to reach our homes
howbeit Zeus did not yet purpose our return stubborn god who roused evil strife again a second time
Then some turned back their curved ships and departed even the lord Odysseus the wise and craftyminded with his company once more showing favour to Agamemnon son of Atreus
but I with the full company of ships that followed me fled on for I knew that the god was devising evil
And the warlike son of Tydeus fled and urged on his men
and late upon our track came fairhaired Menelaus and overtook us in Lesbos  as we were debating the long voyage whether we should sail to seaward of rugged Chios  toward the isle Psyria keeping Chios itself 1 on our left or to landward of Chios past windy Mimas
So we asked the god to shew us a sign
and he shewed it us and bade us cleave through the midst of the sea to Euboea  that we might the soonest escape from misery
And a shrill wind sprang up to blow
and the ships ran swiftly over the teeming ways and at night put in to Geraestus
There on the altar of Poseidon we laid many thighs of bulls thankful to have traversed the great sea
It was the fourth day when in Argos the company of Diomedes son of Tydeus tamer of horses stayed their shapely ships
but I held on toward Pylos  and the wind was not once quenched from the time when the god first sent it forth to blow
Thus I came dear child without tidings nor know I aught of those others who of the Achaeans were saved and who were lost
But what tidings I have heard as I abide in our halls thou shalt hear as is right nor will I hide it from thee
Safely they say came the Myrmidons that rage with the spear whom the famous son of greathearted Achilles led and safely Philoctetes the glorious son of Poias
All his company too did Idomeneus bring to Crete  all who escaped the war and the sea robbed him of none
But of the son of Atreus you have yourselves heard far off though you are how he came and how Aegisthus devised for him a woeful doom
Yet verily he paid the reckoning therefor in terrible wise
so good a thing is it that a son be left behind a man at his death since that son took vengeance on his fathers slayer the guileful Aegisthus for that he slew his glorious father
Thou too friend for I see thou art a comely man and tall be thou valiant that many an one among men yet to be born may praise thee
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Nestor son of Neleus great glory of the Achaeans yea verily that son took vengeance and the Achaeans shall spread his fame abroad that men who are yet to be may hear thereof
O that the gods would clothe me with such strength that I might take vengeance on the wooers for their grievous sin who in wantonness devise mischief against me
But lo the gods have spun for me no such happiness for me or for my father
and now I must in any case endure
Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  answered him
Friend since thou calledst this to my mind and didst speak of it they say that many wooers for the hand of thy mother devise evils in thy halls in thy despite
Tell me art thou willingly thus oppressed or do the people throughout the land hate thee following the voice of a god
Who knows but Odysseus may some day come and take vengeance on them for their violent deedshe alone it may be or even all the host of the Achaeans
Ah would that flashingeyed Athena might choose to love thee even as then she cared exceedingly for glorious Odysseus in the land of the Trojans where we Achaeans suffered woes For never yet have I seen the gods so manifestly shewing love as Pallas Athena did to him standing manifest by his side If she would be pleased to love thee in such wise and would care for thee at heart then would many a one of them utterly forget marriage
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Old man in no wise do I deem that this word will be brought to pass
Too great is what thou sayest
amazement holds me
No hope have I that this will come to pass no not though the gods should so will it
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena spoke to him and said
Telemachus what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth
Easily might a god who willed it bring a man safe home even from afar
But for myself I had rather endure many grievous toils ere I reached home and saw the day of my returning than after my return be slain at my hearth as Agamemnon was slain by the guile of Aegisthus and of his own wife
But of a truth death that is common to all 1 the gods themselves cannot ward from a man they love when the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down
Then wise Telemachus answered her
Mentor no longer let us tell of these things despite our grief
For him no return can ever more be brought to pass nay ere this the immortals have devised for him death and black fate
But now I would make enquiry and ask Nestor regarding another matter since beyond all others he knows judgments and wisdom
for thrice men say has he been king for a generation of men
and like unto an immortal he seems to me to look upon
Nestor son of Neleus do thou tell me truly
how was the son of Atreus wideruling Agamemnon slain
Where was Menelaus
What death did guileful Aegisthus plan for the king since he slew a man mightier far than himself
Was Menelaus not in Achaean Argos but wandering elsewhere among men so that Aegisthus took heart and did the murderous deed
Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  answered him
Then verily my child will I tell thee all the truth
Lo of thine own self thou dost guess how this matter would have fallen out if the son of Atreus fairhaired Menelaus on his return from Troy had found Aegisthus in his halls alive
Then for him not even in death would they have piled the uppiled earth but the dogs and birds would have torn him as he lay on the plain far from the city nor would any of the Achaean women have bewailed him
for monstrous was the deed he devised
We on our part abode there in Troy fulfilling our many toils
but he at ease in a nook of horsepasturing Argos  ever sought to beguile with words the wife of Agamemnon
Now at the first she put from her the unseemly deed the beautiful Clytemnestra
for she had an understanding heart
and with her was furthermore a minstrel whom the son of Atreus straitly charged when he set forth for the land of Troy  to guard his wife
But when at length the doom of the gods bound her that she should be overcome then verily Aegisthus took the minstrel to a desert isle and left him to be the prey and spoil of birds and her willing as he was willing he led to his own house
And many thighpieces he burned upon the holy altars of the gods and many offerings he hung up woven stuffs and gold since he had accomplished a mighty deed beyond all his heart had hoped
Now we were sailing together on our way from Troy  the son of Atreus and I in all friendship
but when we came to holy Sunium the cape of Athens  there Phoebus Apollo assailed with his gentle 1 shafts and slew the helmsman of Menelaus as he held in his hands the steeringoar of the speeding ship even Phrontis son of Onetor who excelled the tribes of men in piloting a ship when the storm winds blow strong
So Menelaus tarried there though eager for his journey that he might bury his comrade and over him pay funeral rites
But when he in his turn as he passed over the winedark sea in the hollow ships reached in swift course the steep height of Malea then verily Zeus whose voice is borne afar planned for him a hateful path and poured upon him the blasts of shrill winds and the waves were swollen to huge size like unto mountains
Then parting his ships in twain he brought some to Crete  where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams of Iardanus
Now there is a smooth cliff sheer towards the sea on the border of Gortyn in the misty deep
where the Southwest Wind drives the great wave against the headland on the left toward Phaestus  and a little rock holds back a great wave
Thither came some of his ships and the men with much ado escaped destruction howbeit the ships the waves dashed to pieces against the reef
But the five other darkprowed ships the wind as it bore them and the wave brought to Egypt 
So he was wandering there with his ships among men of strange speech gathering much livelihood and gold
but meanwhile Aegisthus devised this woeful work at home
Seven years he reigned over Mycenae  rich in gold after slaying the son of Atreus and the people were subdued under him
but in the eighth came as his bane the goodly Orestes back from Athens  and slew his fathers murderer the guileful Aegisthus for that he had slain his glorious father
Now when he had slain him he made a funeral feast for the Argives over his hateful mother and the craven Aegisthus
and on the selfsame day there came to him Menelaus good at the warcry bringing much treasure even all the burden that his ships could bear
So do not thou my friend wander long far from home leaving thy wealth behind thee and men in thy house so insolent lest they divide and devour all thy wealth and thou shalt have gone on a fruitless journey
But to Menelaus I bid and command thee to go
for he has but lately come from a strange land from a folk whence no one would hope in his heart to return whom the storms had once driven astray into a sea so great whence the very birds do not fare in the space of a year so great is it and terrible
But now go thy way with thy ship and thy comrades
or if thou wilt go by land here are chariot and horses at hand for thee and here at thy service are my sons who will be thy guides to goodly Lacedaemon  where lives fairhaired Menelaus
And do thou beseech him thyself that he may tell thee the very truth
A lie will he not utter
for he is wise indeed
So he spoke and the sun set and darkness came on
Then among them spoke the goddess flashingeyed Athena
Old man of a truth thou hast told this tale aright
But come cut out the tongues of the victims and mix the wine that when we have poured libations to Poseidon and the other immortals we may bethink us of sleep
for it is the time thereto
Even now has the light gone down beneath the darkness and it is not fitting
to sit long at the feast of the gods but to go our way
So spoke the daughter of Zeus and they hearkenened to her voice
Heralds poured water over their hands and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink and served out to all pouring first drops for libation into the cups
Then they cast the tongues upon the fire and rising up poured libations upon them
But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their hearts content then verily Athena and godlike Telemachus were both fain to return to the hollow ship
but Nestor on his part sought to stay them and he spoke to them saying
This may Zeus forbid and the other immortal gods that ye should go from my house to your swift ship as from one utterly without raiment and poor who has not cloaks and blankets in plenty in his house whereon both he and his guests may sleep softly
Nay in my house there are cloaks and fair blankets
Never surely shall the dear son of this man Odysseus lie down upon the deck of a ship while I yet live and children after me are left in my halls to entertain strangers even whosoever shall come to my house
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena answered him
Well indeed hast thou spoken in this old friend
and it were fitting for Telemachus to hearken to thee since it is far better thus
But while he shall now follow with thee that he may sleep in thy halls
I for my part will go to the black ship that I may hearten my comrades and tell them all
For alone among them I declare that I am an older man
the others are younger who follow in friendship all of them of like age with greathearted Telemachus
There will I lay me down by the hollow black ship this night
but in the morning I will go to the greathearted Cauconians where a debt is owing to me in no wise new or small
But do thou send this man on his way with a chariot and with thy son since he has come to thy house
and give him horses the fleetest thou host in running and the best in strength
So spoke the goddess flashingeyed Athena and she departed in the likeness of a seaeagle
and amazement fell upon all at the sight
and the old man marvelled when his eyes beheld it
And he grasped the hand of Telemachus and spoke and addressed him
Friend in no wise do I think that thou wilt prove a base man or a craven if verily when thou art so young the gods follow thee to be thy guides
For truly this is none other of those that have their dwellings on Olympus but the daughter of Zeus Tritogeneia 1 the maid most glorious she that honored also thy noble father among the Argives
Nay O Queen be gracious and grant to me fair renown to me and to my sons and to my revered wife
and to thee in return will I sacrifice a sleek 1 heifer broad of brow unbroken which no man hath yet led beneath the yoke
Her will I sacrifice and I will overlay her horns with gold
So he spoke in prayer and Pallas Athena heard him
Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  led them his sons and the husbands of his daughters to his beautiful palace
And when they reached the glorious palace of the king they sat down in rows on the chairs and high seats
and on their coming the old man mixed for them a bowl of sweet wine which now in the eleventh year the housewife opened when she had loosed the string that held the lid
Thereof the old man bade mix a bowl and earnestly he prayed as he poured libations to Athena the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis
But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their hearts content they went each to his home to take their rest But the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  bade Telemachus the dear son of divine Odysseus to sleep there on a corded bedstead under the echoing portico and by him Peisistratus of the good ashen spear a leader of men who among his sons was still unwed in the palace
But he himself slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house and beside him lay the lady his wife who had strewn the couch
Soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered up from his bed rose the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  and went forth and sat down on the polished stones which were before his lofty doors white and glistening as with oil 1
On these of old was wont to sit Neleus the peer of the gods in counsel
but he ere this had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades and now there sat upon them in his turn Nestor of Gerenia  the warder of the Achaeans holding a sceptre in his hands
About him his sons gathered in a throng as they came forth from their chambers Echephron and Stratius and Perseus and Aretus and godlike Thrasymedes
and to these thereafter came as the sixth the lord Peisistratus And they led godlike Telemachus and made him sit beside them
and the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  was first to speak among them
Quickly my dear children fulfil my desire that first of all the gods I may propitiate Athena who came to me in manifest presence to the rich feast of the god
Come now let one go to the plain for a heifer that she may come speedily and that the neatherd may drive her
and let one go to the black ship of greathearted Telemachus and bring all his comrades and let him leave two men only
and let one again bid the goldsmith Laerces come hither that he may overlay the heifers horns with gold
And do ye others abide here together and bid the handmaids within to make ready a feast throughout our glorious halls to fetch seats and logs to set on either side of the altar and to bring clear water
So he spoke and they all set busily to work
The heifer came from the plain and from the swift shapely ship came the comrades of greathearted Telemachus the smith came bearing in his hands his tools of bronze the implements of his craft anvil and hammer and wellmade tongs wherewith he wrought the gold
and Athena came to accept the sacrifice
Then the old man Nestor the driver of chariots gave gold
and the smith prepared it and overlaid therewith the horns of the heifer that the goddess might rejoice when she beheld the offering
And Stratius and goodly Echephron led the heifer by the horns
and Aretus came from the chamber bringing them water for the hands in a basin embossed with flowers and in the other hand he held barley grains in a basket and Thrasymedes steadfast in fight stood by holding in his hands a sharp axe to fell the heifer
and Perseus held the bowl for the blood
Then the old man Nestor driver of chariots began the opening rite of handwashing and sprinkling with barley grains and earnestly he prayed to Athena cutting off as first offering the hair from the head and casting it into the fire
Now when they had prayed and had strewn the barley grains straightway the son of Nestor Thrasymedes high of heart came near and dealt the blow
and the axe cut through the sinews of the neck and loosened the strength of the heifer
Then the women raised the sacred cry the daughters and the sons wives and the revered wife of Nestor Eurydice the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus
and the men raised the heifers head from the broadwayed earth and held it
and Peisistratus leader of men cut the throat
And when the black blood had flowed from her and the life had left the bones at once they cut up the body and straightway cut out the thighpieces all in due order and covered them with a double layer of fat and laid raw flesh upon them
Then the old man burned them on billets of wood and poured over them sparkling wine
and beside him the young men held in their hands the fivepronged forks
But when the thighpieces were wholly burned and they had tasted the inner parts they cut up the rest and spitted and roasted it holding the pointed spits in their hands
Meanwhile the fair Polycaste the youngest daughter of Nestor son of Neleus bathed Telemachus
And when she had bathed him and anointed him richly 1 with oil and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic forth from the bath he came in form like unto the immortals
and he went and sat down by Nestor the shepherd of the people
Now when they had roasted the outer flesh and had drawn it off the spits they sat down and feasted
and worthy men waited on them pouring wine 2 into golden cups
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  was first to speak saying
My sons up yoke for Telemachus horses with beautiful mane beneath the car that he may get forward on his journey
So he spoke and they readily hearkened and obeyed and quickly they yoked beneath the car the swift horses
And the housewife placed in the car bread and wine and dainties such as kings fostered of Zeus are wont to eat
Then Telemachus mounted the beautiful car
and Peisistratus son of Nestor a leader of men mounted beside him and took the reins in his hands He touched the horses with the whip to start them and nothing loath the pair sped on to the plain and left the steep citadel of Pylos 
So all day long they shook the yoke which they bore about their necks
Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark And they came to Pherae to the house of Diocles son of Ortilochus whom Alpheus begot
There they spent the night and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers
So soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car
and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico
Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them and nothing loath the pair sped onward
So they came to the wheatbearing plain and thereafter pressed on toward their journeys end
so well did their swift horses bear them on
And they came to the hollow land of Lacedaemon with its many ravines and drove to the palace of glorious Menelaus
Him they found giving a marriage feast to his many kinsfolk for his noble son and daughter within his house
His daughter he was sending to the son of Achilles breaker of the ranks of men
for in the land of Troy he first had promised and pledged that he would give her and now the gods were bringing their marriage to pass
Her then he was sending forth with horses and chariots to go her way to the glorious city of the Myrmidons over whom her lord was king
but for his son he was bringing to his home from Sparta the daughter of Alector even for the stalwart Megapenthes who was his son wellbeloved 1 born of a slave woman
for to Helen the gods vouchsafed issue no more after that she had at the first borne her lovely child Hermione who had the beauty of golden Aphrodite
So they were feasting in the great highroofed hall the neighbors and kinsfolk of glorious Menelaus and making merry
and among them a divine minstrel was singing to the lyre and two tumblers whirled up and down through the midst of them as he began his song
Then the two the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor halted at the gateway of the palace they and their two horses
And the lord Eteoneus came forth and saw them the busy squire of glorious Menelaus and he went through the hall to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people So he came near and spoke to him winged words
Here are two strangers Menelaus fostered of Zeus two men that are like the seed of great Zeus
But tell me shall we unyoke for them their swift horses or send them on their way to some other host who will give them entertainment
Then stirred to sore displeasure fairhaired Menelaus spoke to him
Aforetime thou was not wont to be a fool Eteoneus son of Boethous
but now like a child thou talkest folly
Surely we two ate full often hospitable cheer of other men ere we came hither in the hope that Zeus would hereafter grant us respite from sorrow
Nay unyoke the strangers horses and lead the men forward into the house that they may feast
So he spoke and the other hastened through the hall and called to the other busy squires to follow along with him
They loosed the sweating horses from beneath the yoke and tied them at the stalls of the horses and flung before them spelt and mixed therewith white barley Then they tilted the chariot against the bright entrance walls and led the men into the divine palace
But at the sight they marvelled as they passed through the palace of the king fostered of Zeus
for there was a gleam as of sun or moon over the highroofed house of glorious Menelaus
But when they had satisfied their eyes with gazing they went into the polished baths and bathed
And when the maids had bathed them and anointed them with oil and had cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics they sat down on chairs beside Menelaus son of Atreus
Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash
and beside them drew up a polished table
And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread and therewith dainties in abundance giving freely of her store
And a carver lifted up and placed before them platters of all manner of meats and set by them golden goblets
Then fairhaired Menelaus greeted the two and said
Take of the food and be glad
and then when you have supped we will ask you who among men you are
for in you two the breed of your sires is not lost but ye are of the breed of men that are sceptred kings fostered of Zeus for base churls could not beget such sons as you
So saying he took in his hands roast meat and set it before them even the fat oxchine which they had set before himself as a mess of honor
So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink lo then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor holding his head close to him that the others might not hear
Son of Nestor dear to this heart of mine mark the flashing of bronze throughout the echoing halls and the flashing of gold of electrum 1 of silver and of ivory
Of such sort methinks is the court of Olympian Zeus within such untold wealth is here
amazement holds me as I look
Now as he spoke fairhaired Menelaus heard him and he spoke and addressed them with winged words
Dear children with Zeus verily no mortal man could vie
for everlasting are his halls and his possessions
but of men another might vie with me in wealth or haply might not
For of a truth after many woes and wide wanderings I brought my wealth home in my ships and came in the eighth year Over Cyprus and Phoenicia I wandered and Egypt  and I came to the Ethiopians and the Sidonians and the Erembi and to Libya  where the lambs are horned from their birth 1
For there the ewes bear their young thrice within the full course of the year
there neither master nor shepherd has any lack of cheese or of meat or of sweet milk but the flocks ever yield milk to the milking the year through
While I wandered in those lands gathering much livelihood meanwhile another slew my brother by stealth and at unawares by the guile of his accursed wife
Thus thou mayest see I have no joy in being lord of this wealth
and you may well have heard of this from your fathers whosoever they may be for full much did I suffer and let fall into ruin a stately house and one stored with much goodly treasure
Would that I dwelt in my halls with but a third part of this wealth and that those men were safe who then perished in the broad land of Troy far from horsepasturing Argos 
And yet though I often sit in my halls weeping and sorrowing for them allone moment indeed I ease my heart with weeping and then again I cease
for men soon have surfeit of chill lament
yet for them all I mourn not so much despite my grief as for one only who makes me to loathe both sleep and food when I think of him for no one of the Achaeans toiled so much as Odysseus toiled and endured
But to himself as it seems his portion was to be but woe and for me there is sorrow never to be forgotten for him in that he is gone so long nor do we know aught whether he be alive or dead
Mourned is he I ween by the old man Laertes and by constant Penelope and by Telemachus whom he left a newborn child in his house
So he spoke and in Telemachus he roused the desire to weep for his father
Tears from his eyelids he let fall upon the ground when he heard his fathers name and with both hands held up his purple cloak before his eyes
And Menelaus noted him and debated in mind and heart whether he should leave him to speak of his father himself or whether he should first question him and prove him in each thing
While he pondered thus in mind and heart forth then from her fragrant highroofed chamber came Helen like Artemis of the golden arrows 1
and with her came Adraste and placed for her a chair beautifully wrought and Alcippe brought a rug of soft wool and Phylo a silver basket which Alcandre had given her the wife of Polybus who dwelt in Thebes of Egypt  where greatest store of wealth is laid up in mens houses
He gave to Menelaus two silver baths and two tripods and ten talents of gold
And besides these his wife gave to Helen also beautiful gifts
a golden distaff and a basket with wheels beneath did she give a basket of silver and with gold were the rims thereof gilded 1
This then the handmaid Phylo brought and placed beside her filled with finelyspun yarn
and across it was laid the distaff laden with violetdark wool
So Helen sat down upon the chair and below was a footstool for the feet
and at once she questioned her husband on each matter and said
Do we know Menelaus fostered of Zeus who these men declare themselves to be who have come to our house
Shall I disguise my thought or speak the truth
Nay my heart bids me speak
For never yet I declare saw I one so like another whether man or womanamazement holds me as I lookas this man is like the son of greathearted Odysseus even Telemachus whom that warrior left a newborn child in his house when for the sake of shameless me ye Achaeans came up under the walls of Troy  pondering in your hearts fierce war
Then fairhaired Menelaus answered her
Even so do I myself now note it wife as thou markest the likeness
Such were his feet such his hands and the glances of his eyes and his head and hair above
And verily but now as I made mention of Odysseus and was telling of all the woe and toil he endured for my sake this youth let fall a bitter tear from beneath his brows holding up his purple cloak before his eyes
Then Peisistratus son of Nestor answered him
Menelaus son of Atreus fostered of Zeus leader of hosts his son indeed this youth is as thou sayest
But he is of prudent mind and feels shame at heart thus on his first coming to make a show of forward words in the presence of thee in whose voice we both take delight as in a gods
But the horseman Nestor of Gerenia  sent me forth to go with him as his guide
for he was eager to see thee that thou mightest put in his heart some word or some deed
For many sorrows has a son in his halls when his father is gone when there are none other to be his helpers even as it is now with Telemachus his father is gone and there are no others among the people who might ward off ruin
Then fairhaired Menelaus answered him and said
Lo now verily is there come to my house the son of a man wellbeloved who for my sake endured many toils
And I thought that if he came back I should give him welcome beyond all the other Argives if Olympian Zeus whose voice is borne afar had granted to us two a return in our swift ships over the sea
And in Argos I would have given him a city to dwell in and would have built him a house when I had brought him from Ithaca with his goods and his son and all his people driving out the dwellers of some one city among those that lie round about and obey me myself as their lord
Then living here should we ofttimes have met together
nor would aught have parted us loving and joying in one another until the black cloud of death enfolded us
Howbeit of this methinks the god himself must have been jealous who to that hapless man alone vouchsafed no return
So he spoke and in them all aroused the desire of lament
Argive Helen wept the daughter of Zeus Telemachus wept and Menelaus son of Atreus nor could the son of Nestor keep his eyes tearless
For he thought in his heart of peerless Antilochus whom the glorious son of the bright Dawn 1 had slain
Thinking of him he spoke winged words
Son of Atreus old Nestor used ever to say that thou wast wise above all men whenever we made mention of thee in his halls and questioned one another
And now if it may in any wise be hearken to me
for I take no joy in weeping at supper time 2 and moreover early dawn will soon be here 3
I count it indeed no blame to weep for any mortal who has died and met his fate
Yea this is the only due we pay to miserable mortals to cut the hair and let a tear fall from the cheeks
For a brother of mine too is dead nowise the meanest of the Argives
and thou mayest well have known him
As for me I never met him nor saw him
but men say that Antilochus was above all others preeminent in speed of foot and as a warrior
Then fairhaired Menelaus answered him and said
My friend truly thou hast said all that a wise man might say or do even one that was older than thou
for from such a father art thou sprung wherefore thou dost even speak wisely Easily known is the seed of that man for whom the son of Cronos spins the thread of good fortune at marriage and at birth even as now he has granted to Nestor throughout all his days continually that he should himself reach a sleek old age in his halls and that his sons in their turn should be wise and most valiant with the spear
But we will cease the weeping which but now was made and let us once more think of our supper and let them pour water over our hands
Tales there will be in the morning also for Telemachus and me to tell to one another to the full
So he spoke and Asphalion poured water over their hands the busy squire of glorious Menelaus
And they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them
Then Helen daughter of Zeus took other counsel
Straightway she cast into the wine of which they were drinking a drug to quiet all pain and strife and bring forgetfulness of every ill
Whoso should drink this down when it is mingled in the bowl would not in the course of that day let a tear fall down over his cheeks no not though his mother and father should lie there dead or though before his face men should slay with the sword his brother or dear son and his own eyes beheld it
Such cunning drugs had the daughter of Zeus drugs of healing which Polydamna the wife of Thon  had given her a woman of Egypt  for there the earth the giver of grain bears greatest store of drugs many that are healing when mixed and many that are baneful
there every man is a physician wise above human kind
for they are of the race of Paeeon
Now when she had cast in the drug and had bidden pour forth the wine again she made answer and said 
Menelaus son of Atreus fostered of Zeus and ye that are here sons of noble men 
though now to one and now to another Zeus gives good and ill 
for he can do all things 
now verily sit ye in the halls and feast and take ye joy in telling tales
for I will tell what fitteth the time
All things I cannot tell or recount even all the labours of Odysseus of the steadfast heart
but what a thing was this which that mighty man wrought and endured in the land of the Trojans where you Achaens suffered woes
Marring his own body with cruel blows and flinging a wretched garment about his shoulders in the fashion of a slave he entered the broadwayed city of the foe
and he hid himself under the likeness of another a beggar he who was in no wise such an one at the ships of the Achaeans
In this likeness he entered the city of the Trojans and all of them were but as babes 1
I alone recognized him in this disguise and questioned him
but he in his cunning sought to avoid me
Howbeit when I was bathing him and anointing him with oil and had put on him raiment and sworn a mighty oath not to make him known among the Trojans as Odysseus before that he reached the swift ships and the huts then at length he told me all the purpose of the Achaeans
And when he had slain many of the Trojans with the long sword he returned to the company of the Argives and brought back plentiful tidings
Then the other Trojan women wailed aloud
but my soul was glad for already my heart was turned to go back to my home and I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite gave me when she led me thither from my dear native land forsaking my child and my bridal chamber and my husband a man who lacked nothing whether in wisdom or in comeliness
Then fairhaired Menelaus answered her and said
Aye verily all this wife hast thou spoken aright
Ere now have I come to know the counsel and the mind of many warriors and have travelled over the wide earth
but never yet have mine eyes beheld such an one as was Odysseus of the steadfast heart
What a thing was this too which that mighty man wrought and endured in the carven horse wherein all we chiefs of the Argives were sitting bearing to the Trojans death and fate
Then thou camest thither
and it must be that thou wast bidden by some god who wished to grant glory to the Trojans
and godlike Deiphobus followed thee on thy way
Thrice didst thou go about the hollow ambush trying it with thy touch and thou didst name aloud the chieftains of the Danaans by their names likening thy voice to the voices of the wives of all the Argives
Now I and the son of Tydeus and goodly Odysseus sat there in the midst and heard how thou didst call
and we two were eager to rise up and come forth or else to answer straightway from within
but Odysseus held us back and stayed us despite our eagerness
Then all the other sons of the Achaeans held their peace but Anticlus alone was fain to speak and answer thee
but Odysseus firmly closed his mouth with strong hands and saved all the Achaeans
and held him thus until Pallas Athena led thee away
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Menelaus son of Atreus fostered of Zeus leader of hosts all the more grievous is it
for in no wise did this ward off from him woeful destruction nay not though the heart within him had been of iron
But come send us to bed that lulled now by sweet sleep we may rest and take our joy
Thus he spoke and Argive Helen bade her handmaids place bedsteads beneath the portico and to lay on them fair purple blankets and to spread there over coverlets and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing
But the maids went forth from the hall with torches in their hands and strewed the couch
and a herald led forth the guests
So they slept there in the forehall of the palace the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor
but the son of Atreus slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house and beside him lay longrobed Helen peerless among women
So soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered up from his bed arose Menelaus good at the warcry and put on his clothing About his shoulders he slung his sharp sword and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals and went forth from his chamber like unto a god to look upon Then he sat down beside Telemachus and spoke and addressed him
What need has brought thee hither prince Telemachus to goodly Lacedaemon over the broad back of the sea
Is it a public matter or thine own
Tell me the truth of this
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Menelaus son of Atreus fostered of Zeus leader of hosts I came if haply thou mightest tell me some tidings of my father
My home is being devoured and my rich lands are ruined with men that are foes my house is filled who are ever slaying my thronging sheep and my sleek kine of shambling gait even the wooers of my mother overweening in their insolence
Therefore am I now come to thy knees if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his woeful death whether thou sawest it haply with thine own eyes or didst hear from some other the story of his wanderings
for beyond all men did his mother bear him to sorrow
And do thou no wise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him
I beseech thee if ever my father noble Odysseus promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it in the land of the Trojans where you Achaeans suffered woes be mindful of it now I pray thee and tell me the truth
Then stirred to sore displeasure fairhaired Menelaus spoke to him
Out upon them for verily in the bed of a man of valiant heart were they fain to lie who are themselves cravens
Even as when in the thicketlair of a mighty lion a hind has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns and roams over the mountain slopes and grassy vales seeking pasture and then the lion comes to his lair and upon the two 1 lets loose a cruel doom so will Odysseus let loose a cruel doom upon these men
I would O father Zeus and Athena and Apollo that in such strength as when once in fairstablished Lesbos he rose up and wrestled a match with Philomeleides and threw him mightily and all the Achaeans rejoiced even in such strength Odysseus might come among the wooers
then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing
But in this matter of which thou dost ask and beseech me verily I will not swerve aside to speak of other things nor will I deceive thee but of all that the unerring old man of the sea told me not one thing will I hide from thee or conceal
In Egypt  1 eager though I was to journey hither the gods still held me back because I offered not to them hecatombs that bring fulfillment
and the gods ever wished that men should be mindful of their commands
Now there is an island in the surging sea in front of Egypt  and men call it Pharos distant as far as a hollow ship runs in a whole day when the shrill wind blows fair behind her
Therein is a harbor with good anchorage whence men launch the shapely ships into the sea when they have drawn supplies of black 2 water
There for twenty days the gods kept me nor ever did the winds that blow over the deep spring up which speed mens ships over the broad back of the sea
And now would all my stores have been spent and the strength of my men had not one of the gods taken pity on me and saved me even Eidothea daughter of mighty Proteus the old man of the sea
for her heart above all others had I moved
She met me as I wandered alone apart from my comrades
who were ever roaming about the island fishing with bent hooks for hunger pinched their bellies
and she came close to me and spoke and said
Art thou so very foolish stranger and slack of wit or art thou of thine own will remiss and hast pleasure in suffering woes
So long art thou pent in the isle and canst find no sign of deliverance 1 and the heart of thy comrades grows faint
So she spoke and I made answer and said
I will speak out and tell thee whosoever among goddesses thou art that in no wise am I pent here of mine own will but it must be that I have sinned against the immortals who hold broad heaven
But do thou tell mefor the gods know all things who of the immortals fetters me here and has hindered me from my path and tell me of my return how I may go over the teeming deep
So I spoke and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer
Then verily stranger will I frankly tell thee all
There is wont to come hither the unerring old man of the sea immortal Proteus of Egypt who knows the depths of every sea and is the servant of Poseidon
He they say is my father that begat me
If thou couldst in any wise lie in wait and catch him he will tell thee thy way and the measure of thy path and of thy return how thou mayest go over the teeming deep
Aye and he will tell thee thou fostered of Zeus if so thou wilt what evil and what good has been wrought in thy halls while thou hast been gone on thy long and grievous way
So she spoke and I made answer and said
Do thou thyself now devise a means of lying in wait for the divine old man lest haply he see me beforehand and being ware of my purpose avoid me
For hard is a god for a mortal man to master
So I spoke and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer
Then verily stranger will I frankly tell thee all
When the sun hath reached midheaven the unerring old man of the sea is wont to come forth from the brine at the breath of the West Wind hidden by the dark ripple And when he is come forth he lies down to sleep in the hollow caves
and around him the seals the brood of the fair daughter of the sea sleep in a herd coming forth from the gray water and bitter is the smell they breathe of the depths of the sea
Thither will I lead thee at break of day and lay you all in a row
for do thou choose carefully three of thy companions who are the best thou hast in thy wellbenched ships
And I will tell thee all the wizard wiles of that old man
First he will count the seals and go over them
but when he has told them all off by fives and beheld them he will lay himself down in their midst as a shepherd among his flocks of sheep
Now so soon as you see him laid to rest thereafter let your hearts be filled with strength and courage and do you hold him there despite his striving and struggling to escape
For try he will and will assume all manner of shapes of all things that move upon the earth and of water and of wondrous blazing fire
Yet do ye hold him unflinchingly and grip him yet the more
But when at length of his own will he speaks and questions thee in that shape in which you saw him laid to rest then hero stay thy might and set the old man free and ask him who of the gods is wroth with thee and of thy return how thou mayest go over the teeming deep
So saying she plunged beneath the surging sea
but I went to my ships where they stood on the sand
and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went
But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea and we had made ready our supper and immortal night had come on
then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea
And as soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered I went along the shore of the broadwayed sea praying earnestly to the gods
and I took with me three of my comrades in whom I trusted most for every adventure
She meanwhile had plunged beneath the broad bosom of the sea and had brought forth from the deep the skins of four seals
and all were newly flayed
and she devised a plot against her father
She had scooped out lairs in the sand of the sea and sat waiting
and we came very near to her
and she made us to lie down in a row and cast a skin over each
Then would our ambush have proved most terrible
for terribly did the deadly stench of the brinebred seals distress us
who would lay him down by a beast of the sea
but she of herself delivered us and devised a great boon
she brought and placed ambrosia of a very sweet fragrance beneath each mans nose and destroyed the stench of the beast
So all the morning we waited with steadfast heart
and the seals came forth from the sea in throngs
These then laid them down in rows along the shore of the sea
and at noon the old man came forth from the sea and found the fatted seals and he went over all and counted their number
Among the creatures he counted us first nor did his heart guess that there was guile
and then he too laid him down
Thereat we rushed upon him with a shout and threw our arms about him nor did that old man forget his crafty wiles
Nay at the first he turned into a bearded lion and then into a serpent and a leopard and a huge boar
then he turned into flowing water and into a tree high and leafy
but we held on unflinchingly with steadfast heart
But when at last that old man skilled in wizard arts grew weary then he questioned me and spoke and said
Who of the gods son of Atreus took counsel with thee that thou mightest lie in wait for me and take me against my will
Of what hast thou need
So he spoke and I made answer and said
Thou knowest old manwhy dost thou seek to put me off with this question
how long a time I am pent in this isle and can find no sign of deliverance and my heart grows faint within me
But do thou tell mefor the gods know all thingswho of the immortals fetters me here and has hindered me from my path and tell me of my return how I may go over the teeming deep
So I spoke and he straightway made answer and said
Nay surely thou oughtest to have made fair offerings to Zeus and the other gods before embarking that with greatest speed thou mightest have come to thy country sailing over the winedark sea
For it is not thy fate to see thy friends and reach thy wellbuilt house and thy native land before that thou hast once more gone to the waters of Aegyptus  the heavenfed river and hast offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods who hold broad heaven
Then at length shall the gods grant thee the journey thou desirest
So he spoke and my spirit was broken within me for that he bade me go again over the misty deep to Aegyptus  a long and weary way
Yet even so I made answer and said
All this will I perform old man even as thou dost bid
But come now tell me this and declare it truly Did all the Achaeans return unscathed in their ships all those whom Nestor and I left as we set out from Troy  Or did any perish by a cruel death on board his ship or in the arms of his friends when he had wound up the skein of war
So I spoke and he straightway made answer and said
Son of Atreus why dost thou question me of this
In no wise does it behove thee to know or to learn my mind
nor methinks wilt thou long be free from tears when thou hast heard all aright
For many of them were slain and many were left
but two chieftains alone of the brazencoated Achaeans perished on their homeward way
 as for the fighting thou thyself wast there
and one I ween still lives and is held back on the broad deep
Aias truly was lost amid his longoared ships
Upon the great rocks of Gyrae Poseidon at first drove him but saved him from the sea
and he would have escaped his doom hated of Athena though he was had he not uttered a boastful word in great blindness of heart
He declared that it was in spite of the gods that he had escaped the great gulf of the sea
and Poseidon heard his boastful speech
and straightway took his trident in his mighty hands and smote the rock of Gyrae and clove it in sunder
And one part abode in its place but the sundered part fell into the sea even that on which Aias sat at the first when his heart was greatly blinded
and it bore him down into the boundless surging deep
So there he perished when he had drunk the salt water
But thy brother escaped indeed the fates and shunned them with his hollow ships
for queenly Hera saved him
But when he was now about to reach the steep height of Malea then the stormwind caught him up and bore him over the teeming deep groaning heavily to the border of the land 1 where aforetime Thyestes dwelt but where now dwelt Thyestes son Aegisthus
But when from hence too a safe return was shewed him and the gods changed the course of the wind that it blew fair and they reached home then verily with rejoicing did Agamemnon set foot on his native land and he clasped his land and kissed it
and many were the hot tears that streamed from his eyes for welcome to him was the sight of his land
Now from his place of watch a watchman saw him whom guileful Aegisthus took and set there promising him as a reward two talents of gold
and he had been keeping guard for a year lest Agamemnon should pass by him unseen and be mindful of his furious might
So he went to the palace to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people
and Aegisthus straightway planned a treacherous device
He chose out twenty men the best in the land and set them to lie in wait but on the further side of the hall he bade prepare a feast
Then he went with chariot and horses to summon Agamemnon shepherd of the people his mind pondering a dastardly deed
So he brought him up all unaware of his doom and when he had feasted him he slew him as one slays an ox at the stall
And not one of the comrades of the son of Atreus was left of all that followed him nor one of the men of Aegisthus but they were all slain in the halls
So he spoke and my spirit was broken within me and I wept as I sat on the sands nor had my heart any longer desire to live and to behold the light of the sun
But when I had had my fill of weeping and writhing then the unerring old man of the sea said to me
No more son of Atreus do thou weep long time thus without ceasing for in it we shall find no help
Nay rather with all the speed thou canst strive that thou mayest come to thy native land
for either thou wilt find Aegisthus alive or haply Orestes may have forestalled thee and slain him and thou mayest chance upon his funeral feast
So he spoke and my heart and spirit were again warmed with comfort in my breast despite my grief and I spoke and addressed him with winged words
Of these men now I know
but do thou name the third who he is that still lives and is held back upon the broad sea or is haply dead
Fain would I hear despite my grief
So I spoke and he straightway made answer and said
It is the son of Laertes whose home is in Ithaca 
Him I saw in an island shedding big tears in the halls of the nymph Calypso who keeps him there perforce
and he cannot come to his native land
for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea
But for thyself Menelaus fostered of Zeus it is not ordained that thou shouldst die and meet thy fate in horsepasturing Argos  but to the Elysian plain and the bounds of the earth will the immortals convey thee where dwells fairhaired Rhadamanthus and where life is easiest for men
No snow is there nor heavy storm nor ever rain but ever does Ocean send up blasts of the shrillblowing West Wind that they may give cooling to men
for thou hast Helen to wife and art in their eyes the husband of the daughter of Zeus
So saying he plunged beneath the surging sea
but I went to my ships with my godlike comrades and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went
But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea and we had made ready our supper and immortal night had come on then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea
And as soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered our ships first of all we drew down to the bright sea and set the masts and the sails in the shapely ships and the men too went on board and sat down upon the benches
and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars
So back again to the waters of Aegyptus  the heavenfed river I sailed and there moored my ships and offered hecatombs that bring fulfillment
But when I had stayed the wrath of the gods that are forever I heaped up a mound to Agamemnon that his fame might be unquenchable
Then when I had made an end of this I set out for home and the immortals gave me a fair wind and brought me swiftly to my dear native land
But come now tarry in my halls until the eleventh or the twelfth day be come
Then will I send thee forth with honor and give thee splendid gifts
three horses and a wellpolished car and besides I will give thee a beautiful cup that thou mayest pour libations to the immortal gods and remember me all thy days
Then wise Telemachus answered him
Son of Atreus keep me no long time here
for verily for a year would I be content to sit in thy house nor would desire for home or parents come upon me
for wondrous is the pleasure I take in listening to thy tales and thy speech
But even now my comrades are chafing in sacred Pylos 
and thou art keeping me long time here
And whatsoever gift thou wouldest give me let it be some treasure
but horses will I not take to Ithaca  but will leave them here for thyself to delight in
for thou art lord of a wide plain wherein is lotus in abundance and galingale and wheat and spelt and broadeared white barley
But in Ithaca there are no widespread courses nor aught of meadowland
It is a pastureland of goats and pleasanter than one that pastures horses
For not one of the islands that lean upon the sea is fit for driving horses
or rich in meadows and Ithaca least of all
So he spoke and Menelaus good at the warcry smiled and stroked him with his hand and spoke and addressed him
Thou art of noble blood dear child that thou speakest thus
Therefore will I change these gifts
for well I may
Of all the gifts that lie stored as treasures in my house I will give thee that one which is fairest and costliest
I will give thee a wellwrought mixing bowl
All of silver it is and with gold are the rims thereof gilded the work of Hephaestus
and the warrior Phaedimus king of the Sidonians gave it me when his house sheltered me as I came thither
and now I am minded to give it to thee
Thus they spoke to one another and meanwhile the banqueters came to the palace of the divine king
They drove up sheep and brought strengthening wine
and their wives with beautiful veils sent them bread
Thus they were busied about the feast in the halls
But the wooers in front of the palace of Odysseus were making merry throwing the discus and the javelin in a levelled place as their wont was in insolence of heart 
and Antinous and godlike Eurymachus were sitting there the leaders of the wooers who in valiance were far the best of all
To them Noemon son of Phronius drew near and he questioned Antinous and spoke and said
Antinous know we at all in our hearts or know we not when Telemachus will return from sandy Pylos 
He is gone taking a ship of mine
and I have need of her to cross over to spacious Elis  where I have twelve brood mares and at the teat sturdy mules as yet unbroken
Of these I would fain drive one off and break him in
So he spoke and they marvelled at heart
for they did not deem that Telemachus had gone to Neleian Pylos but that he was somewhere there on his lands among the flocks or with the swineherd
Then Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke to him saying
Tell me the truth when did he go and what youths went with him
Were they chosen youths of Ithaca  or hirelings and slaves of his own
Able would he be to accomplish even that
And tell me this truly that I may know full well Was it perforce and against thy will that he took from thee the black ship or didst thou give it him freely of thine own will because he besought thee
Then Noemon son of Phronius answered him
I myself freely gave it him
What else could any man do when a man like him his heart laden with care makes entreaty
Hard it were to deny the gift
The youths that are the noblest in the land after ourselves even these have gone with him
and among them I noted one going on board as their leader Mentor or a god who was in all things like unto Mentor
But at this I marvel
I saw goodly Mentor here yesterday at early dawn but at that time he embarked for Pylos 
So saying he departed to his fathers house but of those two the proud hearts were angered
The wooers they straightway made to sit down and cease from their games
and among them spoke Antinous son of Eupeithes in displeasure
and with rage was his black heart wholly filled and his eyes were like blazing fire
Out upon him verily a proud deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus even this journey
and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished
Forth in despite of all of us here the lad is gone without more ado launching a ship and choosing the best men in the land
He will begin by and by to be our bane
but to his own undoing may Zeus destroy his might before ever he reaches the measure of manhood
But come give me a swift ship and twenty men that I may watch in ambush for him as he passes in the strait between Ithaca and rugged Samos  Thus shall his voyaging in search of his father come to a sorry end
So he spoke and they all praised his words and bade him act
And straightway they rose up and went to the house of Odysseus
Now Penelope was no long time without knowledge of the plans which the wooers were plotting in the deep of their hearts
for the herald Medon told her who heard their counsel as he stood without the court
and they within were weaving their plot
So he went through the hall to bear the tidings to Penelope
and as he stepped across the threshold Penelope spoke to him and said
Herald why have the lordly wooers sent thee forth
Was it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease from their tasks and make ready a feast for them
Never wooing 1 any more nor consorting together elsewhere may they now feast here their latest and their last
Seven ye who are ever thronging here and wasting much livelihood the wealth of wise Telemachus
Surely ye hearkened not at all in olden days when ye were children when your fathers told what manner of man Odysseus was among them that begat you in that he wrought no wrong in deed or word to any man in the land as the wont is of divine kings
one man they hate and another they love
Yet he never wrought iniquity at all to any man
But your mind and your unseemly deeds are plain to see nor is there in after days any gratitude for good deeds done
Then Medon wise of heart answered her
I would O queen that this were the greatest evil
But another greater far and more grievous are the wooers planning which I pray that the son of Cronos may never bring to pass
They are minded to slay Telemachus with the sharp sword on his homeward way
for he went in quest of tidings of his father to sacred Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon 
So he spoke and her knees were loosened where she sat and her heart melted
Long time she was speechless and both her eyes were filled with tears and the flow of her voice was checked
But at last she made answer and said to him
Herald why is my son gone
He had no need to go on board swiftfaring ships which serve men as horses of the deep and cross over the wide waters of the sea
Was it that not even his name should be left among men
Then Medon wise of heart answered her
I know not whether some god impelled him or whether his own heart was moved to go to Pylos  that he might learn either of his fathers return or what fate he had met
So he spoke and departed through the house of Odysseus
and on her fell a cloud of soulconsuming grief and she had no more the heart to sit upon one of the many seats that were in the room but down upon the threshold of her fairwrought chamber she sank moaning piteously
and round about her wailed her handmaids even all that were in the house both young and old
Among these with sobs of lamentation spoke Penelope
Hear me my friends
for to me the Olympian has given sorrow above all the women who were bred and born with me
For long since I lost my noble husband of the lion heart preeminent in all manner of worth among the Danaans my noble husband whose fame is wide through Hellas and mid Argos 
And now again my wellloved son have the stormwinds swept away from our halls without tidings nor did I hear of his setting forth
Cruel that ye are Not even you took thought any one of you to rouse me from my couch though in your hearts ye knew full well when he went on board the hollow black ship
For had I learned that he was pondering this journey he should verily have stayed here how eager soever to be gone or he should have left me dead in the halls
But now let one hasten to call hither the aged Dolius my servant whom my father gave me or ever I came hither and who keeps my garden of many trees that he may straightway go and sit by Laertes and tell him of all these things So haply may Laertes weave some plan in his heart and go forth and with weeping make his plea to the people who are minded to destroy his race and that of godlike Odysseus
Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her
Dear lady thou mayest verily slay me with the pitiless sword or let me abide in the house
yet will I not hide my word from thee
I knew all this and gave him whatever he bade me bread and sweet wine
But he took from me a mighty oath not to tell thee until at least the twelfth day should come or thou shouldst thyself miss him and hear that he was gone that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with weeping
But now bathe thyself and take clean raiment for thy body and then go up to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids and pray to Athena the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis
for she may then save him even from death
And trouble not a troubled old man
for the race of the son of Arceisius is not methinks utterly hated by the blessed gods but there shall still be one I ween to hold the highroofed halls and the rich fields far away
So she spoke and lulled Penelopes laments and made her eyes to cease from weeping
She then bathed and took clean raiment for her body and went up to her upper chamber with her handmaids and placing barley grains in a basket prayed to Athena
Hear me child of Zeus who bears the aegis unwearied one If ever Odysseus of many wiles burnt to thee in his halls fat thighpieces of heifer or ewe remember these things now I pray thee and save my dear son and ward off from him the wooers in their evil insolence
So saying she raised the sacred cry and the goddess heard her prayer
But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls
and thus would one of the proud youths speak
Aye verily the queen wooed of many is preparing our marriage nor does she know at all that death has been made ready for her son
So would one of them speak but they knew not how these things were to be
And Antinous addressed their company and said
Good sirs 1 shun haughty speech of every kind alike lest someone report your speech even within the house
Nay come in silence thus let us arise and put into effect our plan which pleased us one and all at heart
So he spoke and chose twenty men that were best and they went their way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea
The ship first of all they drew down to the deep water and set the mast and sail in the black ship and fitted the oars in the leathern tholestraps all in due order and spread the white sail
And proud squires brought them their weapons
Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship and themselves disembarked
There then they took supper and waited till evening should come
But she the wise Penelope lay there in her upper chamber touching no food tasting neither meat nor drink pondering whether her peerless son would escape death or be slain by the insolent wooers
And even as a lion is seized with fear and broods amid a throng of men when they draw their crafty ring about him so was she pondering when sweet 1 sleep came upon her
And she sank back and slept and all her joints relaxed
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena took other counsel
She made a phantom and likened it in form to a woman Iphthime daughter of greathearted Icarius whom Eumelus wedded whose home was in Pherae
And she sent it to the house of divine Odysseus to Penelope in the midst of her wailing and lamenting to bid her cease from weeping and tearful lamentation
So into the chamber it passed by the thong of the bolt and stood above her head and spoke to her and said
Sleepest thou Penelope thy heart sore stricken
Nay the gods that live at ease suffer thee not to weep or be distressed seeing that thy son is yet to return
for in no wise is he a sinner in the eyes of the gods
Then wise Penelope answered her as she slumbered very sweetly at the gates of dreams
Why sister art thou come hither
Thou hast not heretofore been wont to come for thou dwellest in a home far away
And thou biddest me cease from my grief and the many pains that distress me in mind and heart Long since I lost my noble husband of the lion heart preeminent in all manner of worth among the Danaans my noble husband whose fame is wide in Hellas and mid Argos 
And now again my wellloved son is gone forth in a hollow ship a mere child knowing naught of toils and the gatherings of men
For him I sorrow even more than for that other
and tremble for him and fear lest aught befall him whether it be in the land of the men to whom he is gone or on the sea
For many foes are plotting against him eager to slay him before he comes back to his native land
Then the dim phantom answered her and said
Take heart and be not in thy mind too sore afraid
since such a guide goes with him as men have full often besought to stand by their side for she has power even Pallas Athena
And she pities thee in thy sorrow
for she it is that has sent me forth to tell thee this
Then again wise Penelope answered her
If thou art indeed a god and hast listened to the voice of a god come tell me I pray thee also of that hapless one whether he still lives and beholds the light of the sun or whether he is already dead and in the house of Hades
And the dim phantom answered her and said
Nay of him I may not speak at length whether he be alive or dead
it is an ill thing to speak words vain as wind
So saying the phantom glided away by the bolt of the door into the breath of the winds
And the daughter of Icarius started up from sleep
and her heart was warmed with comfort that so clear a vision had sped to her in the darkness 1 of night
But the wooers embarked and sailed over the watery ways pondering in their hearts utter murder for Telemachus
There is a rocky isle in the midst of the sea midway between Ithaca and rugged Samos  Asteris of no great size
but therein is a harbor where ships may lie with an entrance on either side
Now Dawn arose from her couch from beside lordly Tithonus to bear light to the immortals and to mortal men
And the gods were sitting down to council and among them Zeus who thunders on high whose might is supreme
To them Athena was recounting the many woes of Odysseus as she called them to mind
for it troubled her that he abode in the dwelling of the nymph
Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are forever never henceforward let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle nor let him heed righteousness in his mind but let him ever be harsh and work unrighteousness
seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was yet gentle was he as a father
He verily abides in an island suffering grievous pains in the halls of the nymph Calypso who keeps him perforce
and he cannot return to his own land
for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea
And now again they are minded to slay his wellloved son on his homeward way
for he went in quest of tidings of his father to sacred Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon 
Then Zeus the cloudgatherer answered her and said
My child what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth
Didst thou not thyself devise this plan that verily Odysseus might take vengeance on these men at his coming
But concerning Telemachus do thou guide him in thy wisdom for thou canst that all unscathed he may reach his native land and the wooers
may come back in their ship baffled in their purpose
He spoke and said to Hermes his dear son
Hermes do thou now seeing that thou art at other times our messenger declare to the fairtressed nymph our fixed resolve even the return of Odysseus of the steadfast heart that he may return with guidance neither of gods nor of mortal men
but that on a stoutlybound raft suffering woes he may come on the twentieth day to deepsoiled Scheria  the land of the Phaeacians who are near of kin to the gods These shall heartily shew him all honor as if he were a god and shall send him in a ship to his dear native land after giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from Troy  if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil
For in this wise it is his fate to see his friends and reach his highroofed house and his native land
So he spoke and the messenger Argeiphontes failed not to hearken
Straightway he bound beneath his feet his beautiful sandals immortal golden which were wont to bear him over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind
And he took the wand wherewith he lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will while others again he awakens even out of slumber
With this in his hand the strong Argeiphontes flew
On to Pieria he stepped from the upper air
and he swooped down upon the sea and then sped over the wave like a bird the cormorant which in quest of fish over the dread gulfs of the unresting sea wets its thick plumage in the brine
In such wise did Hermes ride upon the multitudinous waves
But when he had reached the island which lay afar then forth from the violet sea he came to land and went his way until he came to a great cave wherein dwelt the fairtressed nymph
and he found her within
A great fire was burning on the hearth and from afar over the isle there was a fragrance of cleft cedar and juniper as they burned
but she within was singing with a sweet voice as she went to and fro before the loom weaving with a golden shuttle
Round about the cave grew a luxuriant wood alder and poplar and sweetsmelling cypress
Therein birds long of wing were wont to nest owls and falcons and seacrows with chattering tongues who ply their business on the sea
And right there about the hollow cave ran trailing a garden vine in pride of its prime richly laden with clusters
And fountains four in a row were flowing with bright water hard by one another turned one this way one that
And round about soft meadows of violets and parsley were blooming
There even an immortal who chanced to come might gaze and marvel and delight his soul
and there the messenger Argeiphontes stood and marvelled
But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things straightway he went into the wide cave
Nor did Calypso the beautiful goddess fail to know him when she saw him face to face
for not unknown are the immortal gods to one another even though one dwells in a home far away
But the greathearted Odysseus he found not within for he sat weeping on the shore as his wont had been racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs
and he would look over the unresting sea shedding tears
And Calypso the beautiful goddess questioned Hermes when she had made him sit on a bright shining chair
Why pray Hermes of the golden wand hast thou come an honorable guest and welcome
heretofore thou hast not been wont to come
Speak what is in thy mind
my heart bids me fulfil it if fulfil it I can and it is a thing that hath fulfillment
But follow me further that I may set before thee entertainment
So saying the goddess set before him a table laden with ambrosia and mixed the ruddy nectar
So he drank and ate the messenger Argeiphontes
But when he had dined and satisfied his soul with food then he made answer and addressed her saying
Thou a goddess dost question me a god upon my coming
and I will speak my word truly
since thou biddest me
It was Zeus who bade me come hither against my will
Who of his own will would speed over so great space of salt seawater great past telling
Nor is there at hand any city of mortals who offer to the gods sacrifice and choice hecatombs
But it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus who bears the aegis
He says that there is here with thee a man most wretched above all those warriors who around the city of Priam fought for nine years and in the tenth year sacked the city and departed homeward
But on the way they sinned against Athena and she sent upon them an evil wind and long waves
There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished but as for him the wind and the wave as they bore him brought him hither
Him now Zeus bids thee to send on his way with all speed
for it is not his fate to perish here far from his friends but it is still his lot to see his friends and reach his highroofed house and his native land
So he spoke and Calypso the beautiful goddess shuddered and she spoke and addressed him with winged words
Cruel are ye O ye gods and quick to envy above all others seeing that ye begrudge goddesses that they should mate with men openly if any takes a mortal as her dear bedfellow
Thus when rosyfingered Dawn took to herself Orion ye gods that live at ease begrudged her till in Ortygia chaste Artemis of the golden throne assailed him with her gentle 1 shafts and slew him
Thus too when fairtressed Demeter yielding to her passion lay in love with Iasion in the thriceploughed fallow land
Zeus was not long without knowledge thereof but smote him with his bright thunderbolt and slew him
And even so again do ye now begrudge me O ye gods that a mortal man should abide with me
Him I saved when he was bestriding the keel and all alone for Zeus had smitten his swift ship with his bright thunderbolt and had shattered 2 it in the midst of the winedark sea
There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished but as for him the wind and the wave as they bore him brought him hither
Him I welcomed kindly and gave him food and said that I would make him immortal and ageless all his days
But since it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus who bears the aegis let him go his way if Zeus thus orders and commands over the unresting sea
But it is not I that shall give him convoy
for I have at hand no ships with oars and no men to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea
But with a ready heart will I give him counsel and will hide naught that all unscathed he may return to his native land
Then again the messenger Argeiphontes answered her
Even so send him forth now and beware of the wrath of Zeus lest haply he wax wroth and visit his anger upon thee hereafter
So saying the strong Argeiphontes departed
and the queenly nymph went to the greathearted Odysseus when she had heard the message of Zeus
Him she found sitting on the shore
and his eyes were never dry of tears and his sweet life was ebbing away as he longed mournfully for his return for the nymph was no longer pleasing in his sight
By night indeed he would sleep by her side perforce in the hollow caves unwilling beside the willing nymph
but by day he would sit on the rocks and the sands racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs and he would look over the unresting sea shedding tears
Then coming close to him the beautiful goddess addressed him
Unhappy man sorrow no longer here I pray thee nor let thy life pine away
for even now with a ready heart will I send thee on thy way
Nay come hew with the axe long beams and make a broad raft
and fasten upon it crossplanks for a deck well above it that it may bear thee over the misty deep
And I will place therein bread and water and red wine to satisfy thy heart to keep hunger from thee And I will clothe thee with raiment
I will send a fair wind behind thee that all unscathed thou mayest return to thy native land if it be the will of the gods who hold broad heaven for they are mightier than I both to purpose and to fulfil
So she spoke and muchenduring goodly Odysseus shuddered and he spoke and addressed her with winged words
Some other thing goddess art thou planning in this and not my sending seeing that thou biddest me cross on a raft the great gulf of the sea dread and grievous
over which not even the shapely swiftfaring ships pass rejoicing in the wind of Zeus
But I will not set foot on a raft in thy despite unless thou goddess wilt bring thyself to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt
So he spoke but Calypso the beautiful goddess smiled and stroked him with her hand and spoke and addressed him
Verily thou art a knave and not stunted in wit that thou hast bethought thee to utter such a word
Now therefore let earth be witness to this and the broad heaven above and the downflowing water of the Styx which is the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods that I will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt
Nay I have such thoughts in mind and will give such counsel as I should devise for mine own self if such need should come on me
For I too have a mind that is righteous and the heart in this breast of mine is not of iron but hath compassion
So saying the beautiful goddess led the way quickly
and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess
And they came to the hollow cave the goddess and the man and he sat down upon the chair from which Hermes had arisen and the nymph set before him all manner of food to eat and drink of such sort as mortal men eat
But she herself sat over against divine Odysseus and before her the handmaids set ambrosia and nectar
So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them
But when they had their fill of food and drink Calypso the beautiful goddess was the first to speak and said
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices wouldst thou then fare now forthwith home to thy dear native land
Yet even so fare thee well
Howbeit if in thy heart thou knewest all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil before thou comest to thy native land thou wouldest abide here and keep this house with me and wouldest be immortal for all thy desire to see thy wife for whom thou longest day by day
Surely not inferior to her do I declare myself to be either in form or stature for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should vie with immortals in form or comeliness
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her and said
Mighty goddess be not wroth with me for this
I know full well of myself that wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou in comeliness and in stature
for she is a mortal while thou art immortal and ageless
But even so I wish and long day by day to reach my home and to see the day of my return
And if again some god shall smite me on the winedark sea I will endure it having in my breast a heart that endures affliction
For ere this I have suffered much and toiled much amid the waves and in war
let this also be added unto that
So he spoke and the sun set and darkness came on
And the two went into the innermost recess of the hollow cave and took their joy of love abiding each by the others side
As soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered straightway Odysseus put on a cloak and a tunic and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe finely woven and beautiful and about her waist she cast a fair girdle of gold and on her head a veil above
Then she set herself to plan the sending of the greathearted Odysseus
She gave him a great axe well fitted to his hands an axe of bronze sharpened on both sides
and in it was a beautiful handle of olive wood securely fastened
and thereafter she gave him a polished adze
Then she led the way to the borders of the island where tall trees were standing alder and popular and fir reaching to the skies long dry and wellseasoned which would float for him lightly
But when she had shewn him where the tall trees grew Calypso the beautiful goddess returned homewards but he fell to cutting timbers
and his work went forward apace
Twenty trees in all did he fell and trimmed them with the axe then he cunningly smoothed them all and made them straight to the line
Meanwhile Calypso the beautiful goddess brought him augers
and he bored all the pieces and fitted them to one another and with pegs and morticings did he hammer it together
Wide as a man wellskilled in carpentry marks out the curve of the hull of a freightship broad of beam even so wide did Odysseus make his raft
And he set up the deckbeams bolting them to the closeset ribs and laboured on
and he finished the raft with long gunwales
In it he set a mast and a yardarm fitted to it
and furthermore made him a steeringoar wherewith to steer
Then he fenced in the whole from stem to stern with willow withes to be a defence against the wave
and he strewed much brush thereon 1
Meanwhile Calypso the beautiful goddess brought him cloth to make him a sail
and he fashioned that too with skill
And he made fast in the raft braces and halyards and sheets and then with levers 2 forced it down into the bright sea
Now the fourth day came and all his work was done
And on the fifth the beautiful Calypso sent him on his way from the island after she had bathed him and clothed him in fragrant raiment
On the raft the goddess put a skin of dark wine and another a great one of water and provisions too he put in a wallet
Therein she put abundance of dainties to satisfy his heart
and she sent forth a gentle wind and warm
Gladly then did goodly Odysseus spread his sail to the breeze
and he sat and guided his raft skilfully with the steeringoar nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids as he watched the Pleiads and latesetting Bootes and the Bear which men also call the Wain which ever circles where it is and watches Orion and alone has no part in the baths of Ocean
For this star Calypso the beautiful goddess had bidden him to keep on the left hand as he sailed over the sea
For seventeen days then he sailed over the sea and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of the land of the Phaeacians where it lay nearest to him
and it shewed like unto a shield in the misty deep
But the glorious Earthshaker as he came back from the Ethiopians 1 beheld him from afar from the mountains of the Solymi
for Odysseus was seen of him sailing over the sea
and he waxed the more wroth in spirit and shook his head and thus he spoke to his own heart
Out on it Surely the gods have changed their purpose regarding Odysseus while I was among the Ethiopians And lo he is near to the land of the Phaeacians where it is his fate to escape from the great bonds of the woe which has come upon him
Aye but even yet methinks I shall drive him to surfeit of evil
So saying he gathered the clouds and seizing his trident in his hands troubled the sea
and he roused all blasts of all manner of winds and hid with clouds land and sea alike
and night rushed down from heaven
Together the East Wind and the South Wind dashed and the fierceblowing West Wind and the North Wind  born in the bright heaven rolling before him a mighty wave
Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and his heart melted and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit
Ah me wretched that I am What is to befall me at the last
I fear me that verily all that the goddess said was true when she declared that on the sea before ever I came to my native land I should fill up my measure of woes
and lo all this now is being brought to pass
In such wise does Zeus overcast the broad heaven with clouds and has stirred up the sea and the blasts of all manner of winds sweep upon me
now is my utter destruction sure
Thrice blessed those Danaans aye four times blessed who of old perished in the wide land of Troy  doing the pleasure of the sons of Atreus
Even so would that I had died and met my fate on that day when the throngs of the Trojans hurled upon me bronzetipped spears fighting around the body of the dead son of Peleus
Then should I have got funeral rites and the Achaeans would have spread my fame
but now by a miserable death was it appointed me to be cut off
Even as thus he spoke the great wave smote him from on high rushing upon him with terrible might and around it whirled his raft
Far from the raft he fell and let fall the steeringoar from his hand
but his mast was broken in the midst by the fierce blast of tumultuous winds that came upon it and far in the sea sail and yardarm fell
As for him long time did the wave hold him in the depths nor could he rise at once from beneath the onrush of the mighty wave
for the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him weighed him down
At length however he came up and spat forth from his mouth the bitter brine which flowed in streams from his head
Yet even so he did not forget his raft in evil case though he was but sprang after it amid the waves and laid hold of it and sat down in the midst of it seeking to escape the doom of death
and a great wave ever bore him this way and that along its course
As when in autumn the North Wind bears the thistletufts over the plain and close they cling to one another so did the winds bear the raft this way and that over the sea
Now the South Wind would fling it to the North Wind to be driven on and now again the East Wind would yield it to the West Wind to drive
But the daughter of Cadmus  Ino of the fair ankles saw him even Leucothea who of old was a mortal of human speech but now in the deeps of the sea has won a share of honor from the gods
She was touched with pity for Odysseus as he wandered and was in sore travail and she rose up from the deep like a seamew on the wing and sat on the stoutlybound raft and spoke saying
Unhappy man how is it that Poseidon the earthshaker has conceived such furious wrath against thee that he is sowing for thee the seeds of many evils
Yet verily he shall not utterly destroy thee for all his rage
Nay do thou thus and methinks thou dost not lack understanding
Strip off these garments and leave thy raft to be driven by the winds but do thou swim with thy hands and so strive to reach the land of the Phaeacians where it is thy fate to escape
Come take this veil and stretch it beneath thy breast It is immortal
there is no fear that thou shalt suffer aught or perish
But when with thy hands thou hast laid hold of the land loose it from thee and cast it into the winedark sea far from the land and thyself turn away
So saying the goddess gave him the veil and herself plunged again into the surging deep like a seamew
and the dark wave hid her
Then the muchenduring goodly Odysseus pondered and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit
Woe is me Let it not be that some one of the immortals is again weaving a snare for me that she bids me leave my raft
Nay but verily I will not yet obey for afar off mine eyes beheld the land where she said I was to escape
But this will I do and meseems that this is best
as long as the timbers hold firm in their fastenings so long will I remain here and endure to suffer affliction
but when the wave shall have shattered the raft to pieces I will swim seeing that there is naught better to devise
While he pondered thus in mind and heart Poseidon the earthshaker made to rise up a great wave dread and grievous arching over from above and drove it upon him
And as when a strong wind tosses a heap of straw that is dry
and some it scatters here some there
even so the wave scattered the long timbers of the raft
But Odysseus bestrode one plank as though he were riding a horse and stripped off the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him
Then straightway he stretched the veil beneath his breast and flung himself headlong into the sea with hands outstretched ready to swim
And the lord the earthshaker saw him and he shook his head and thus he spoke to his own heart
So now after thou hast suffered many ills go wandering over the deep till thou comest among the folk fostered of Zeus
Yet even so methinks thou shalt not make any mock at thy suffering
So saying he lashed his fairmaned horses and came to Aegae  where is his glorious palace
But Athena daughter of Zeus took other counsel
She stayed the paths of the other winds and bade them all cease and be lulled to rest
but she roused the swift North Wind  and broke the waves before him to the end that Zeusborn Odysseus might come among the Phaeacians lovers of the oar escaping from death and the fates
Then for two nights and two days he was driven about over the swollen waves and full often his heart forboded destruction
But when fairtressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day then the wind ceased and there was a windless calm
and he caught sight of the shore close at hand casting a quick glance forward as he was raised up by a great wave
And even as when most welcome to his children appears the life of a father who lies in sickness bearing grievous pains long while wasting away and some cruel god assails him but then to their joy the gods free him from his woe so to Odysseus did the land and the wood seem welcome and he swam on eager to set foot on the land
But when he was as far away as a mans voice carries when he shouts and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs
for the great wave thundered against the dry land belching upon it in terrible fashion and all things were wrapped in the foam of the sea
for there were neither harbors where ships might ride nor roadsteads
but projecting headlands and reefs and cliffs
then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit
Ah me when Zeus has at length granted me to see the land beyond my hopes and lo I have prevailed to cleave my way and to cross this gulf nowhere doth there appear a way to come forth from the grey sea
For without are sharp crags and around them the wave roars foaming and the rock runs up sheer and the water is deep close in shore so that in no wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape ruin
Haply were I to seek to land a great wave may seize me and dash me against the jagged rock
and so shall my striving be in vain
But if I swim on yet further in hope to find shelving beaches 1 and harbors of the sea I fear me lest the stormwind may catch me up again and bear me groaning heavily over the teeming deep or lest some god may even send forth upon me some great monster from out the seaand many such does glorious Amphitrite breed
For I know that the glorious Earthshaker is filled with wrath against me
While he pondered thus in mind and heart a great wave bore him against the rugged shore
There would his skin have been stripped off and his bones broken had not the goddess flashingeyed Athena put a thought in his mind
On he rushed and seized the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning until the great wave went by
Thus then did he escape this wave but in its backward flow it once more rushed upon him and smote him and flung him far out in the sea
And just as when a cuttlefish is dragged from its hole many pebbles cling to its suckers even so from his strong hands were bits of skin stripped off against the rocks
and the great wave covered him
Then verily would hapless Odysseus have perished beyond his fate had not flashingeyed Athena given him prudence
Making his way forth from the surge where it belched upon the shore he swam outside looking ever toward the land in hope to find shelving beaches and harbors of the sea
But when as he swam he came to the mouth of a fairflowing river where seemed to him the best place since it was smooth of stones and besides there was shelter from the wind he knew the river as he flowed forth and prayed to him in his heart
Hear me O king whosoever thou art
As to one greatly longedfor 1 do I come to thee seeking to escape from out the sea from the threats of Poseidon
Reverend even in the eyes of the immortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer even as I have now come to thy stream and to thy knees after many toils
Nay pity me O king
for I declare that I am thy suppliant
So he spoke and the god straightway stayed his stream and checked the waves and made a calm before him and brought him safely to the mouth of the river
And he let his two knees bend and his strong hands fall
for his spirit was crushed by the sea
And all his flesh was swollen and sea water flowed in streams up through his mouth and nostrils
So he lay breathless and speechless with scarce strength to move for terrible weariness had come upon him
But when he revived and his spirit returned again into his breast then he loosed from him the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river that murmured seaward
and the great wave bore it back down the stream and straightway Ino received it in her hands
But Odysseus going back from the river sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth the giver of grain
and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit
Ah woe is me what is to befall me
What will happen to me at the last
If here in the river bed I keep watch throughout the weary night I fear that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may overcome me when from feebleness I have breathed forth my spirit
and the breeze from the river blows cold in the early morning
But if I climb up the slope to the shady wood and lie down to rest in the thick brushwood in the hope that the cold and weariness might leave me and if sweet sleep comes over me I fear me lest I become a prey and spoil to wild beasts
Then as he pondered this thing seemed to him the better
he went his way to the wood and
he found it near the water in a clear space
and he crept beneath two bushes that grew from the same spot
one of thorn and one of olive
Through these the strength of the wet winds could never blow nor the rays of the bright sun beat nor could the rain pierce through them
so closely did they grow intertwining one with the other
Beneath these Odysseus crept
and he straightway gathered with his hands a broad bed
for fallen leaves were there in plenty enough to shelter two men or three in wintertime however bitter the weather
And the muchenduring goodly Odysseus saw it and was glad and he lay down in the midst and heaped over him the fallen leaves
And as a man hides a brand beneath the dark embers in an outlying farm a man who has no neighbors and so saves a seed of fire that he may not have to kindle it from some other source so Odysseus covered himself with leaves
And Athena shed sleep upon his eyes that it might enfold his lids and speedily free him from toilsome weariness
So he lay there asleep the muchenduring goodly Odysseus overcome with sleep and weariness
but Athena went to the land and city of the Phaeacians These dwelt of old in spacious Hypereia hard by the Cyclopes men overweening in pride who plundered them continually and were mightier than they
From thence Nausithous the godlike had removed them and led and settled them in Scheria far from men that live by toil About the city he had drawn a wall he had built houses and made temples for the gods and divided the ploughlands
but he ere now had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades and Alcinous was now king made wise in counsel by the gods
To his house went the goddess flashingeyed Athena to contrive the return of greathearted Odysseus
She went to a chamber richly wrought wherein slept a maiden like the immortal goddesses in form and comeliness Nausicaa the daughter of greathearted Alcinous hard by slept two handmaidens gifted with beauty by the Graces one on either side of the doorposts
and the bright doors were shut
But like a breath of air the goddess sped to the couch of the maiden and stood above her head and spoke to her taking the form of the daughter of Dymas famed for his ships a girl who was of like age with Nausicaa and was dear to her heart
Likening herself to her the flashingeyed Athena spoke and said
Nausicaa how comes it that thy mother bore thee so heedless
Thy bright raiment is lying uncared for yet thy marriage is near at hand when thou must needs thyself be clad in fair garments and give other such to those who escort thee
It is from things like these thou knowest that good report goeth up among men and the father and honored mother rejoice
Nay come let us go to wash them at break of day
for I will follow with thee to aid thee that thou mayest with speed make thee ready for thou shalt not long remain a maiden
Even now thou hast suitors in the land the noblest of all the Phaeacians from whom is thine own lineage
Nay come bestir thy noble father early this morning that he make ready mules and a wagon for thee to bear the girdles and robes and bright coverlets
And for thyself too it is far more seemly to go thus than on foot
for the washing tanks are far from the city
So saying the goddess flashingeyed Athena departed to Olympus  where they say is the abode of the gods that stands fast forever
Neither is it shaken by winds nor ever wet with rain nor does snow fall upon it but the air is outspread clear and cloudless and over it hovers a radiant whiteness
Therein the blessed gods are glad all their days
and thither went the flashingeyed one when she had spoken all her word to the maiden
At once then came fairthroned Dawn and awakened Nausicaa of the beautiful robes
and straightway she marvelled at her dream and went through the house to tell her parents her father dear and her mother
and she found them both within
The mother sat at the hearth with her handmaidens spinning the yarn of purple dye
and her father she met as he was going forth to join the glorious kings in the place of council to which the lordly Phaeacians called him
But she came up close to her dear father and said
Papa dear wilt thou not make ready for me a wagon high and stout of wheel that I may take to the river for washing the goodly raiment of mine which is lying here soiled
Moreover for thyself it is seemly that when thou art at council with the princes
thou shouldst have clean raiment upon thee
and thou hast five sons living in thy hallstwo are wedded but three are sturdy bachelors
and these ever wish to put on them freshlywashed raiment when they go to the dance
Of all this must I take thought
So she spoke
for she was ashamed to name gladsome 1 marriage to her father
but he understood all and answered saying
Neither the mules do I begrudge thee my child nor aught beside
Go thy way
the slaves shall make ready for thee the wagon high and stout of wheel and fitted with a box above 2
With this he called to the slaves and they hearkened
Outside the palace they made ready the lightrunning mule wagon and led up the mules and yoked them to it
and the maiden brought from her chamber the bright raiment
and she placed it upon the polished car while her mother put in a chest food of all sorts to satisfy the heart Therein she put dainties and poured wine in a goatskin flask
and the maiden mounted upon the wagon
Her mother gave her also soft olive oil in a flask of gold that she and her maidens might have it for the bath
Then Nausicaa took the whip and the bright reins and smote the mules to start them
and there was a clatter of the mules
as they sped on a main bearing the raiment and the maiden neither went she alone for with her went her handmaids as well
Now when they came to the beautiful streams of the river where were the washing tanks that never failedfor abundant clear water welled up from beneath and flowed over to cleanse garments however soiled
there they loosed the mules from under the wagon and drove them along the eddying river to graze on the honeysweet watergrass
Now and they themselves took in their arms the raiment from the wagon and bore it into the dark water and trampled it in the trenches busily vying each with each
Now when they had washed the garments and had cleansed them of all the stains they spread them out in rows on the shore of the sea where the waves dashing against the land washed the pebbles cleanest
and they after they had bathed and anointed themselves richly with oil took their meal on the rivers banks and waited for the clothing to dry in the bright sunshine
Then when they had had their joy of food she and her handmaids they threw off their headgear and fell to playing at ball
and whitearmed Nausicaa was leader in the song 1
And even as Artemis the archer roves over the mountains along the ridges of lofty Taygetus or Erymanthus joying in the pursuit of boars and swift deer
and with her sport the woodnymphs the daughters of Zeus who bears the aegis and Leto is glad at heart
high above them all Artemis holds her head and brows and easily may she be known though all are fair
so amid her handmaidens shone the maid unwed
But when she was about to yoke the mules and fold the fair raiment in order to return homeward then the goddess flashingeyed Athena took other counsel that Odysseus might awake and see the fairfaced maid who should lead him to the city of the Phaeacians
So then the princess tossed the ball to one of her maidens
So the maiden indeed she missed but cast it into a deep eddy
and thereat they cried aloud
and goodly Odysseus awoke and sat up and thus he pondered in mind and heart
Woe is me to the land of what mortals am I now come
Are they cruel and wild and unjust or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts
There rang in my ears a cry as of maidens
of nymphs who haunt the towering peaks of the mountains the springs that feed the rivers and the grassy meadows
Can it be that I am somewhere near men of human speech
Nay I will myself make trial and see
So saying the goodly Odysseus came forth from beneath the bushes and with his stout hand he broke from the thick wood a leafy branch that he might hold it about him and hide therewith his nakedness
Forth he came like a mountainnurtured lion trusting in his might who goes forth beaten with rain and wind but his two eyes are ablaze
into the midst of the kine he goes or of the sheep or on the track of the wild deer
and his belly bids him go even into the closebuilt fold to make an attack upon the flocks
Even so Odysseus was about to enter the company of the fairtressed maidens naked though he was
for need had come upon him
But terrible did he seem to them all befouled with brine and they shrank in fear one here one there along the jutting sandspits
Alone the daughter of Alcinous kept her place
for in her heart Athena put courage and took fear from her limbs
She fled not but stood and faced him
and Odysseus pondered whether he should clasp the knees of the fairfaced maid and make his prayer or whether standing apart as he was he should beseech her with gentle words in hope that she might show him the city and give him raiment
And as he pondered it seemed to him better to stand apart and beseech her with gentle words lest the maidens heart should be wroth with him if he clasped her knees
so straightway he spoke a gentle word and crafty
I beseech thee O queen
a goddess art thou or art thou mortal
If thou art a goddess one of those who hold broad heaven to Artemis the daughter of great Zeus do I liken thee most nearly in comeliness and in stature and in form
But if thou art one of mortals who dwell upon the earth thriceblessed then are thy father and thy honored mother and thriceblessed thy brethren
Full well I ween are their hearts ever warmed with joy because of thee as they see thee entering the dance a plant 1 so fair
But he again is blessed in heart above all others who shall prevail with his gifts of wooing and lead thee to his home
For never yet have mine eyes looked upon a mortal such as thou whether man or woman
amazement holds me as I look on thee
Of a truth in Delos once I saw such a thing a young shoot of a palm springing up beside the altar of Apollo
for thither too I went and much people followed with me on that journey on which evil woes were to be my portioneven so when I saw that I marvelled long at heart for never yet did such a tree spring up from the earth
And in like manner lady do I marvel at thee and am amazed and fear greatly to touch thy knees
but sore grief has come upon me
Yesterday on the twentieth day I escaped from the winedark sea
but ever until then the wave and the swift winds bore me from the island of Ogygia
and now fate has cast me ashore here that here too haply I may suffer some ill
For not yet methinks will my troubles cease but the gods ere that will bring many to pass
Nay O queen have pity
for it is to thee first that I am come after many grievous toils and of the others who possess this city and land I know not one
Shew me the city and give me some rag to throw about me if thou hadst any wrapping for the clothes when thou camest hither
And for thyself may the gods grant thee all that thy heart desires a husband and a home may they grant thee and oneness of hearta goodly gift
For nothing is greater or better than this when man and wife dwell in a home in one accord
a great grief to their foes and a joy to their friends but they know it 1 best themselves
Then whitearmed Nausicaa answered him
Stranger since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless
and it is Zeus himself the Olympian that gives happy fortune to men both to the good and the evil to each man as he will
so to thee I ween he has given this lot and thou must in any case endure it
But now since thou hast come to our city and land thou shalt not lack clothing or aught else of those things which befit a soretried suppliant when he cometh in the way
The city will I shew thee and will tell thee the name of the people
The Phaeacians possess this city and land and I am the daughter of greathearted Alcinous upon whom depend the might and power of the Phaeacians
She spoke and called to her fairtressed handmaids
Stand my maidens
Whither do ye flee at the sight of a man
Ye do not think surely that he is an enemy
That mortal man lives not or exists 1 nor shall ever be born who shall come to the land of the Phaeacians as a foeman
for we are very dear to the immortals
Far off we dwell in the surging sea the furthermost of men and no other mortals have dealings with us
Nay this is some hapless wanderer that has come hither Him must we now tend
for from Zeus are all strangers and beggars and a gift though small is welcome
Come then my maidens give to the stranger food and drink and bathe him in the river in a spot where there is shelter from the wind
So she spoke and they halted and called to each other Then they set Odysseus in a sheltered place as Nausicaa the daughter of greathearted Alcinous bade and
beside him they put a cloak and a tunic for raiment and gave him soft olive oil in the flask of gold and bade him bathe in the streams of the river
Then among the maidens spoke goodly Odysseus
Maidens stand yonder apart that by myself I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with olive oil
for of a truth it is long since oil came near my skin
But in your presence will I not bathe
for I am ashamed to make me naked in the midst of fairtressed maidens
So he said and they went apart and told the princess
But with water from the river goodly Odysseus washed from his skin the brine which clothed his back and broad shoulders and from his head he wiped the scurf of the unresting sea
But when he had washed his whole body and anointed himself with oil and had put on him the raiment which the unwedded maid had given him then Athena the daughter of Zeus made him taller to look upon and mightier and from his head she made the locks to flow in curls like unto the hyacinth flower
And as when a man overlays silver with gold a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft and full of grace is the work he produces even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders
Then he went apart and sat down on the shore of the sea gleaming with beauty and grace
and the damsel marvelled at him
She spoke to her fairtressed handmaids saying
Listen whitearmed maidens that I may say somewhat
Not without the will of all the gods who hold Olympus does this man come among the godlike Phaeacians
Before he seemed to me uncouth but now he is like the gods who hold broad heaven
Would that a man such as he might be called my husband dwelling here and that it might please him here to remain
But come my maidens give to the stranger food and drink
So she spoke and they readily hearkened and obeyed and set before Odysseus food and drink
Then verily did the muchenduring goodly Odysseus drink and eat ravenously
for long had he been without taste of food
But the whitearmed Nausicaa took other counsel
She folded the raiment and put it in the fair wagon and yoked the stouthoofed mules and mounted the car herself Then she hailed Odysseus and spoke and addressed him
Rouse thee now stranger to go to the city that I may escort thee to the house of my wise father where I tell thee thou shalt come to know all the noblest of the Phaeacians
Only do thou thus and methinks thou dost not lack understanding
so long as we are passing through the country and the tilled fields of men go thou quickly with the handmaids behind the mules and the wagon
and I will lead the way
But when we are about to enter the city around which runs a lofty walla fair harbor lies on either side of the city and the entrance is narrow
and curved ships are drawn up along the road
for they all have stations for their ships each man one for himself
There too is their place of assembly about the fair temple of Poseidon fitted with huge 1 stones set deep in the earth
Here the men are busied with the tackle of their black ships with cables and sails and here they shape the thin oarblades
For the Phaeacians care not for bow or quiver but for masts and oars of ships and for the shapely ships rejoicing in which they cross over the grey sea
It is their ungentle speech that I shun lest hereafter some man should taunt me
for indeed there are insolent folk in the land
and thus might some baser fellow say shall he meet us
Who is this that follows Nausicaa a comely man and tall a stranger
Where did she find him
He will doubtless be a husband for her
Haply she has brought from his ship some wanderer of a folk that dwell afarfor none are near us
or some god long prayedfor has come down from heaven in answer to her prayers and she will have him as her husband all her days
Better so even if she has herself gone forth and found a husband from another people
for of a truth she scorns the Phaeacians here in the land where she has wooers many and noble
So will they say and this would become a reproach to me
Yea I would myself blame another maiden who should do such thing and in despite of her dear father and mother while yet they live should consort with men before the day of open marriage
Nay stranger do thou quickly hearken to my words that with all speed thou mayest win from my father an escort and a return to thy land
Thou wilt find a goodly grove of Athena hard by the road a grove of poplar trees
In it a spring wells up and round about is a meadow
There is my fathers park and fruitful vineyard as far from the city as a mans voice carries when he shouts
Sit thou down there and wait for a time until we come to the city and reach the house of my father
But when thou thinkest that we have reached the house then do thou go to the city of the Phaeacians and ask for the house of my father greathearted Alcinous
Easily may it be known and a child could guide thee a mere babe
for the houses of the Phaeacians are no wise built of such sort as is the palace of the lord Alcinous
But when the house and the court enclose thee pass quickly through the great hall till thou comest to my mother
She sits at the hearth in the light of the fire spinning the purple yarn a wonder to behold leaning against a pillar
and her handmaids sit behind her
There too leaning against the selfsame pillar is set the throne of my father whereon he sits and quaffs his wine like unto an immortal
Him pass thou by and cast thy hands about my mothers knees that thou mayest quickly see with rejoicing the day of thy return though thou art come from never so far
If in her sight thou dost win favour then there is hope that thou wilt see thy friends and return to thy wellbuilt house and unto thy native land
So saying she smote the mules with the shining whip
and they quickly left the streams of the river
Well did they trot well did they ply their ambling feet 1
and she drove with care that the maidens and Odysseus might follow on foot and with judgment did she ply the lash
Then the sun set and they came to the glorious grove sacred to Athena There Odysseus sat him down
and he straightway prayed to the daughter of great Zeus
Hear me child of aegisbearing Zeus unwearied one
Hearken now to my prayer since aforetime thou didst not hearken when I was smitten what time the glorious Earthshaker smote me
Grant that I may come to the Phaeacians as one to be welcomed and to be pitied
So he spoke in prayer and Pallas Athena heard him
but she did not yet appear to him face to face
for she feared her fathers brother
but he furiously raged against godlike Odysseus until at length he reached his own land
So he prayed there the muchenduring goodly Odysseus while the two strong mules bore the maiden to the city
But when she had come to the glorious palace of her father she halted the mules at the outer gate and her brothers thronged about her men like the immortals and loosed the mules from the wagon and bore the raiment within
and she herself went to her chamber
There a fire was kindled for her by her waitingwoman Eurymedusa an aged dame from Apeire
Long ago the curved ships had brought her from Apeire and men had chosen her from the spoil as a gift of honor for Alcinous for that he was king over all the Phaeacians and the people hearkened to him as to a god
She it was who had reared the whitearmed Nausicaa in the palace
and she it was who kindled the fire for her and made ready her supper in the chamber
Then Odysseus roused himself to go to the city
and Athena with kindly purpose cast about him a thick mist that no one of the greathearted Phaeacians meeting him should speak mockingly to him and ask him who he was
But when he was about to enter the lovely city then the goddess flashingeyed Athena met him in the guise of a young maiden carrying a pitcher
and she stood before him and goodly Odysseus questioned her saying
My child couldst thou not guide me to the house of him they call Alcinous who is lord among the people here
For I am come hither a stranger soretried from afar from a distant country
wherefore I know no one of the people who possess this city and land
Then the goddess flashingeyed Athena answered him
Then verily Sir stranger I will shew thee the palace as thou dost bid me for it lies hard by the house of my own noble father
Only go thou quietly and I will lead the way But turn not thine eyes upon any man nor question any
for the men here endure not strangerfolk nor do they give kindly welcome to him who comes from another land
They indeed trusting in the speed of their swift ships cross over the great gulf of the sea for this the Earthshaker has granted them
and their ships are swift as a bird on the wing or as a thought
So speaking Pallas Athena led the way quickly
and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess And as he went through the city in the midst of them
the Phaeacians famed for their ships took no heed of him
for fairtressed Athena the dread goddess would not suffer it but shed about him a wondrous mist for her heart was kind toward him
And Odysseus marvelled at the harbors and the stately ships at the meetingplaces where the heroes themselves gathered and the walls long and high and crowned with palisades a wonder to behold
But when they had come to the glorious palace of the king the goddess flashingeyed Athena was the first to speak saying
Here Sir stranger is the house which thou didst bid me shew to thee
and thou wilt find the kings fostered of Zeus feasting at the banquet
Go thou within and let thy heart fear nothing
for a bold man is better in all things though he be a stranger from another land
The queen shalt thou approach first in the palace
Arete is the name by which she is called and she is sprung from the same line as is the king Alcinous
Nausithous at the first was born from the earthshaker Poseidon and Periboea the comeliest of women youngest daughter of greathearted Eurymedon who once was king over the insolent Giants
But he brought destruction on his froward people and was himself destroyed
But with Periboea lay Poseidon and begat a son greathearted Nausithous who ruled over the Phaeacians
and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and Alcinous
Rhexenor when as yet he had no son Apollo of the silver bow smote in his hall a bridegroom though he was and he left only one daughter Arete
Her Alcinous made his wife and honored her as no other woman on earth is honored of all those who in these days direct their households in subjection to their husbands
so heartily is she honored and has ever been by her children and by Alcinous himself and by the people who look upon her as upon a goddess and greet her as she goes through the city
For she of herself is no wise lacking in good understanding
and for the women 1 to whom she has good will she makes an end of strife even among their husbands
If in her sight thou dost win favour then there is hope that thou wilt see thy friends and return to thy highroofed house and unto thy native land
So saying flashingeyed Athena departed over the unresting sea and left lovely Scheria  She came to Marathon and broadwayed Athens  and entered the wellbuilt house of Erectheus
but Odysseus went to the glorious palace of Alcinous
There he stood and his heart pondered much before he reached the threshold of bronze
for there was a gleam as of sun or moon over the highroofed house of greathearted Alcinous
Of bronze were the walls that stretched this way and that from the threshold to the innermost chamber and around was a cornice of cyanus 2
Golden were the doors that shut in the wellbuilt house
and doorposts of silver were set in a threshold of bronze Of silver was the lintel above and of gold the handle
On either side of the door there stood gold and silver dogs which Hephaestus had fashioned with cunning skill to guard the palace of greathearted Alcinous immortal were they and ageless all their days 3
Within seats were fixed along the wall on either hand from the threshold to the innermost chamber and on them were thrown robes of soft fabric cunningly woven the handiwork of women
On these the leaders of the Phaeacians were wont to sit drinking and eating
for they had unfailing store
And golden youths stood on wellbuilt pedestals holding lighted torches in their hands to give light by night to the banqueters in the hall
And fifty slavewomen he had in the house of whom some grind the yellow grain on the millstone and others weave webs or as they sit twirl the yarn like unto the leaves 1 of a tall poplar tree and from the closelywoven linen the soft olive oil drips down 2
For as the Phaeacian men are skilled above all others in speeding a swift ship upon the sea
so are the women cunning workers at the loom
for Athena has given to them above all others skill in fair handiwork and an understanding heart
But without the courtyard hard by the door is a great orchard of four acres 3
and a hedge runs about it on either side
Therein grow trees tall and luxuriant pears and pomegranates and appletrees with their bright fruit and sweet figs and luxuriant olives
Of these the fruit perishes not nor fails in winter or in summer but lasts throughout the year
and ever does the west wind as it blows quicken to life some fruits and ripen others
pear upon pear waxes ripe apple upon apple cluster upon cluster and fig upon fig
There too is his fruitful vineyard planted one part of which a warm spot on level ground is being dried in the sun while other grapes men are gathering and others too they are treading
but in front are unripe grapes that are shedding the blossom and others that are turning purple
There again by the last row of the vines grow trim garden beds of every sort blooming the year through
and therein are two springs one of which sends its water throughout all the garden while the other over against it flows beneath the threshold of the court toward the high house from this the townsfolk drew their water
Such were the glorious gifts of the gods in the palace of Alcinous
There the muchenduring goodly Odysseus stood and gazed
But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things he passed quickly over the threshold into the house
There he found the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians pouring libations from their cups to the keensighted Argeiphontes to whom they were wont to pour the wine last of all when they were minded to go to their rest
But the muchenduring goodly Odysseus went through the hall wrapped in the thick mist which Athena had shed about him till he came to Arete and to Alcinous the king
About the knees of Arete Odysseus cast his hands and straightway the wondrous mist melted from him
and a hush fell upon all that were in the room at sight of the man
and they marvelled as they looked upon him
But Odysseus made his prayer
Arete daughter of godlike Rhexenor to thy husband and to thy knees am I come after many toilsaye and to these banqueters
to whom may the gods grant happiness in life and may each of them hand down to his children the wealth in his halls and the dues of honor which the people have given him
But for me do ye speed my sending that I may come to my native land and that quickly for long time have I been suffering woes far from my friends
So saying he sat down on the hearth in the ashes by the fire
and they were all hushed in silence
But at length there spoke among them the old lord Echeneus who was an elder among the Phaeacians well skilled in speech and understanding all the wisdom of old
He with good intent addressed the assembly and said
Alcinous lo this is not the better way nor is it seemly that a stranger should sit upon the ground on the hearth in the ashes but these others hold back waiting for thy word
Come make the stranger to arise and set him upon a silverstudded chair and bid the heralds mix wine that we may pour libations also to Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants
And let the housewife give supper to the stranger of the store that is in the house
When the strong and mighty Alcinous heard this he took by the hand Odysseus the wise and craftyminded and raised him from the hearth and set him upon a bright chair from which he bade his son the kindly 1 Laodamas to rise for he sat next to him and was his best beloved
Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold and poured it over a silver basin for him to wash
and beside him she drew up a polished table
And the grave housewife brought and set before him bread and therewith dainties in abundance giving freely of her store
So the muchenduring goodly Odysseus drank and ate
and then the mighty Alcinous spoke to the herald and said
Pontonous mix the bowl and serve wine to all in the hall that we may pour libations also to Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants
He spoke and Pontonous mixed the honeyhearted wine and served out to all pouring first drops for libation into the cups
But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their hearts content Alcinous addressed the assembly and spoke among them
Hearken to me leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me
Now that ye have finished your feast go each of you to his house to rest
But in the morning we will call more of the elders together and will entertain the stranger in our halls and offer goodly victims to the gods After that we will take thought also of his sending that without toil or pain yon stranger may under our sending come to his native land speedily and with rejoicing though he come from never so far Nor shall he meanwhile suffer any evil or harm until he sets foot upon his own land
but thereafter he shall suffer whatever Fate and the dread Spinners spun with their thread for him at his birth when his mother bore him
But if he is one of the immortals come down from heaven then is this some new thing which the gods are planning
for ever heretofore have they been wont to appear to us in manifest form when we sacrifice to them glorious hecatombs and they feast among us sitting even where we sit
Aye and if one of us as a lone wayfarer meets them they use no concealment for we are of near kin to them as are the Cyclopes and the wild tribes of the Giants
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said
Alcinous far from thee be that thought
for I am not like the immortals who hold broad heaven either in stature or in form but like mortal men
Whomsoever ye know among men who bear greatest burden of woe to them might I liken myself in my sorrows
Yea and I could tell a yet longer tale of all the evils which I have endured by the will of the gods
But as for me suffer me now to eat despite my grief
for there is nothing more shameless than a hateful belly which bids a man perforce take thought thereof be he never so sore distressed and laden with grief at heart even as I too am laden with grief at heart yet ever does my belly bid me eat and drink and makes me forget all that I have suffered and commands me to eat my fill
But do ye make haste at break of day that ye may set me hapless one on the soil of my native land even after my many woes
Yea let life leave me when I have seen once more my possessions my slaves and my great highroofed house
So he spoke and they all praised his words and bade send the stranger on his way since he had spoken fittingly
Then when they had poured libations and had drunk to their hearts content they went each man to his home to take their rest and goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall and beside him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous
Then and the handmaids cleared away the dishes of the feast
Then whitearmed Arete was the first to speak
for as she saw it she knew his fair raiment the mantle and tunic which she herself had wrought with her handmaids
And she spoke and addressed him with winged words
Stranger this question will I myself ask thee first
Who art thou among men and from whence
Who gave thee this raiment
Didst thou not say that thou camest hither wandering over the sea
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her and said
Hard were it O queen to tell to the end the tale of my woes since full many have the heavenly gods given me
But this will I tell thee of which thou dost ask and enquire
There is an isle Ogygia which lies far off in the sea
Therein dwells the fairtressed daughter of Atlas guileful Calypso a dread goddess
and with her no one either of gods or mortals hath aught to do
but me in my wretchedness did fate bring to her hearth alone for Zeus had smitten my swift ship with his bright thunderbolt and had shattered it in the midst of the winedark sea
There all the rest of my trusty comrades perished but I clasped in my arms the keel of my curved ship and was borne drifting for nine days
and on the tenth black night the gods brought me to the isle Ogygia where the fairtressed Calypso dwells a dread goddess She took me to her home with kindly welcome and gave me food and said that she would make me immortal and ageless all my days
but she could never persuade the heart in my breast
There for seven years space I remained continually and ever with my tears would I wet the immortal raiment which Calypso gave me
But when the eight year came in circling course then she roused me and bade me go either because of some message from Zeus or because her own mind was turned
And she sent me on my way on a raft stoutly bound and gave me abundant store of bread and sweet wine and clad me in immortal raiment and sent forth a gentle wind and warm
So for seventeen days I sailed over the sea and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of your land and my heart was glad illstarred that I was
for verily I was yet to have fellowship with great woe which Poseidon the earthshaker sent upon me For he stirred up the winds against me and stayed my course and wondrously roused the sea nor would the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft as I groaned ceaselessly
My raft indeed the storm shattered
but by swimming I clove my way through yon gulf of the sea until the wind and the waves as they bore me brought me to your shores
There had I sought to land the waves would have hurled me upon the shore and dashed me against the great crags and a cheerless place
but I gave way and swam back until I came to a river where seemed to me the best place since it was smooth of rocks and besides there was shelter from the wind
Forth then I staggered and sank down gasping for breath and immortal night came on
Then I went forth from the heavenfed river and lay down to sleep in the bushes gathering leaves about me
A god shed over me infinite sleep
So there among the leaves I slept my heart sore stricken the whole night through until the morning and until midday
and the sun turned to his setting 1 ere sweet sleep released me
Then I saw the handmaids of thy daughter on the shore at play and amid them was she fair as the goddesses
To her I made my prayer
and she in no wise failed in good understanding to do as thou wouldst not deem that one of younger years would do on meeting thee
for younger folk are ever thoughtless
She gave bread in plenty and sparkling wine and bathed me in the river and gave me this raiment
In this for all my sorrows have I told thee the truth
Then in turn Alcinous answered him and said
Stranger verily my daughter was not minded aright in this that she did not bring thee to our house with her maidens Yet it was to her first that thou didst make thy prayer
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said
Prince rebuke not for this I pray thee thy blameless daughter
She did indeed bid me follow with her maidens but I would not for fear and shame lest haply thy heart should darken with wrath as thou sawest it
for we are quick to anger we tribes of men upon the earth
And again Alcinous answered him and said
Stranger not such is the heart in my breast to be filled with wrath without a cause
Better is due measure in all things
I would O father Zeus and Athena and Apollo that thou so goodly a man and likeminded with me wouldst have my daughter to wife and be called my son and abide here
a house and possessions would I give thee if thou shouldst choose to remain
but against thy will shall no one of the Phaeacians keep thee
let not that be the will of father Zeus
But as for thy sending that thou mayest know it surely I appoint a time thereto even the morrow
Then shalt thou lie down overcome by sleep and they shall row thee over the calm sea until thou comest to thy country and thy house or to whatsoever place thou wilt aye though it be even far beyond Euboea  which those of our people who saw it when they carried fairhaired Rhadamanthus to visit Tityus the son of Gaea say is the furthest of lands
Thither they went and without toil accomplished their journey and on the selfsame day came back home
So shalt thou too know for thyself how far my ships are the best and my youths at tossing the brine with the oarblade
So said he and the muchenduring goodly Odysseus was glad and he spoke in prayer and said
Father Zeus grant that Alcinous may bring to pass all that he has said
So shall his fame be unquenchable over the earth the giver of grain and I shall reach my native land
Thus they spoke to one another
and whitearmed Arete bade her maidens place a bedstead under cover of the portico and to lay on it fair blankets of purple and to spread there over coverlets and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing
So they went forth from the hall with torches in their hands
But when they had busily spread the stoutbuilt bedstead they came to Odysseus and called to him and said
Rouse thee now stranger to go to thy rest
thy bed is made
Thus they spoke and welcome did it seem to him to lay him down to sleep
So there he slept the muchenduring goodly Odysseus on the corded bedstead under the echoing portico
But Alcinous lay down in the inmost chamber of the lofty house and beside him lay the lady his wife who had strewn the couch
As soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered the strong and mighty Alcinous rose from his couch and up rose also Zeusborn Odysseus the sacker of cities
And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way to the place of assembly of the Phaeacians which was builded for them hard by their ships
Thither they came and sat down on the polished stones close by one another
and Pallas Athena went throughout the city in the likeness of the herald of wise Alcinous devising a return for greathearted Odysseus To each mans side she came and spoke and said
Hither now leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians come to the place of assembly that you may learn of the stranger who has newly come to the palace of wise Alcinous after his wanderings over the sea and in form is like unto the immortals
So saying she roused the spirit and heart of each man
and speedily the place of assembly and the seats were filled with men that gathered
And many marvelled at the sight of the wise son of Laertes
for wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon his head and shoulders and she made him taller and sturdier to behold that he might be welcomed by all the Phaeacians and win awe and reverence and might accomplish the many feats wherein the Phaeacians made trial of Odysseus
Now when they were assembled and met together Alcinous addressed their assembly and spoke among them
Hearken to me leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians that I may speak what the heart in my breast bids me
This strangerI know not who he ishas come to my house in his wanderings whether from men of the east or of the west
He urges that he be sent on his way and prays for assurance
and let us on our part as of old we were wont speed on his sending
for verily no man soever who comes to my house abides here long in sorrow for lack of sending
Nay come let us draw a black ship down to the bright sea for her first voyage and let men choose two and fifty youths from out the people even those that have heretofore been the best
And when you have all duly lashed the oars to the tholepins 1 go ashore
and then go your way to my house and prepare a feast with speed
and I will provide bountifully for all
To the youths this is my command
but do you others the sceptred kings come to my fair palace that we may entertain yon stranger in the halls and let no man say me nay
And summon hither the divine minstrel Demodocus
for to him above all others has the god granted skill in song to give delight in whatever way his spirit prompts him to sing
So saying he led the way and the sceptred kings followed him
while a herald went for the divine minstrel
And chosen youths two and fifty went as he bade to the shore of the unresting sea
And when they had come down to the ship and to the sea they drew the black ship down to the deep water and placed the mast and sail in the black ship and fitted the oars in the leathern tholestraps all in due order and spread the white sail
Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship
and they then went their way to the great palace of the wise Alcinous
Filled were the porticoes and courts and rooms with the men that gathered
for many there were both young and old
For them Alcinous slaughtered twelve sheep and eight whitetusked boars and two oxen of shambling gait
These they flayed and dressed and made ready a goodly feast
Then the herald drew near leading the good minstrel whom the Muse loved above all other men and gave him both good and evil
of his sight she deprived him but gave him the gift of sweet song
For him Pontonous the herald set a silverstudded chair in the midst of the banqueters leaning it against a tall pillar
and he hung the cleartoned lyre from a peg close above his head and showed him how to reach it with his hands
And beside him he placed a basket and a beautiful table and a cup of wine to drink when his heart should bid him
So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink the Muse moved the minstrel to sing of the glorious deeds of warriors from that lay the fame whereof had then reached broad heaven even the quarrel of Odysseus and Achilles son of Peleus how once they strove with furious words at a rich feast of the gods and Agamemnon king of men was glad at heart that the best of the Achaeans were quarrelling
for thus Phoebus Apollo in giving his response had told him that it should be in sacred Pytho  when he passed over the threshold of stone to enquire of the oracle
For then the beginning of woe was rolling upon Trojans and Danaans through the will of great Zeus
This song the famous minstrel sang
but Odysseus grasped his great purple cloak with his stout hands and drew it down over his head and hid his comely face
for he had shame of the Phaeacians as he let fall tears from beneath his eyebrows
Yea and as often as the divine minstrel ceased his singing Odysseus would wipe away his tears and draw the cloak from off his head and taking the twohandled cup would pour libations to the gods
But as often as he began again and the nobles of the Phaeacians bade him sing because they took pleasure in his lay Odysseus would again cover his head and moan
Now from all the rest he concealed the tears that he shed but Alcinous alone marked him and took heed for he sat by him and heard him groaning heavily
And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians lovers of the oar
Hear me ye leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians
already have we satisfied our hearts with the equal banquet and with the lyre which is the companion of the rich feast
But now let us go forth and make trial of all manner of games that yon stranger may tell his friends when he returns home how far we excel other men in boxing and wrestling and leaping and in speed of foot
So saying he led the way and they followed him
From the peg the herald hung the cleartoned lyre and took Demodocus by the hand and led him forth from the hall
T guiding him by the selfsame road by which the others the nobles of the Phaeacians had gone to gaze upon the games
They went their way to the place of assembly and with them went a great throng past counting
and up rose many noble youths
There rose Acroneus and Ocyalus and Elatreus and Nauteus and Prymneus and Anchialus and Eretmeus and Ponteus and Proreus Thoon and Anabesineus and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton
and up rose also Euryalus the peer of mandestroying Ares the son of Naubolus who in comeliness and form was the best of all the Phaeacians after peerless Laodamas
and up rose the three sons of noble Alcinous Laodamas and Halius and godlike Clytoneus
These then first made trial in the footrace
A course was marked out for them from the turning point 1
and they all sped swiftly raising the dust of the plain
but among them noble Clytoneus was far the best at running
and by as far as is the range 2 of a team of mules in fallow land by so far he shot to the front and reached the host and the others were left behind
Then they made trial of toilsome wrestling
and here in turn Euryalus excelled all the princes
And in leaping Amphialus was best of all
and with the discus again far the best of all was Elatreus and in boxing Laodamas the good son of Alcinous
But when the hearts of all had taken pleasure in the contests Laodamas the son of Alcinous spoke among them
Come friends let us ask yon stranger whether he knows and has learned any contests
In build surely he is no mean man in thighs and calves and in his two arms above his stout neck and his great might
In no wise does he lack aught of the strength of youth but he has been broken by many troubles
For to my mind there is naught worse than the sea to confound a man be he never so strong
And Euryalus in turn answered him and said
Laodamas this word of thine is right fitly spoken
Go now thyself and challenge him and make known thy word
Now when the good son of Alcinous heard this he came and took his stand in the midst and spoke to Odysseus
Come Sir stranger do thou too make trial of the contests if thou knowest any
and it must be that thou knowest contests
for there is no greater glory for a man so long as he lives than that which he achieves by his own hands and his feet
Nay come make trial and cast away care from thy heart
Thy journey shall no more be long delayed nay even now thy ship is launched and the crew is ready
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said
Laodamas why do ye mock me with this challenge
Sorrow is in my mind far more than contests seeing that in time past I have suffered much and toiled much and now I sit in the midst of your assembly longing for my return home and making my prayer to the king and to all the people
Then again Euryalus made answer and taunted him to his face
Nay verily stranger for I do not liken thee to a man that is skilled in contests such as abound among men but to one who faring to and fro with his benched ship is a captain of sailors who are merchantmen one who is mindful of his freight and has charge of a homeborne cargo and the gains of his greed
Thou dost not look like an athlete
Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him
Stranger thou hast not spoken well
thou art as one blind with folly
So true is it that the gods do not give gracious gifts to all alike not form nor mind nor eloquence
For one man is inferior in comeliness but the god sets a crown 1 of beauty upon his words and men look upon him with delight
and he speaks on unfalteringly with sweet modesty and is conspicuous among the gathered people and as he goes through the city men gaze upon him as upon a god
Another again is in comeliness like the immortals but no crown of grace is set about his words So in thy case thy comeliness is preeminent nor could a god himself mend it but in mind thou art stunted
Thou hast stirred the spirit in my breast by speaking thus unmannerly
I am not unskilled in sports as thou pratest nay methinks I was among the first so long as I trusted in my youth and in my hands
But now I am bound by suffering and pains
for much have I endured in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves
But even so though I have suffered much I will make trial of the contests for thy word has stung me to the heart and thou hast provoked me with thy speech
He spoke and leaping up with his cloak about him as it was seized a discus larger than the rest and thick no little heavier than those with which the Phaeacians were wont to contend one with another
This with a whirl he sent from his stout hand and the stone hummed as it flew
and down they crouched to the earth the Phaeacians of the long oars men famed for their ships beneath the rush of the stone
Past the marks of all it flew speeding lightly from his hand
and Athena in the likeness of a man set the mark and she spoke and addressed him
Even a blind man stranger could distinguish this mark groping for it with his hands for it is in nowise confused with the throng of the others but is far the first
Be thou of good cheer for this bout at least
no one of the Phaeacians will reach this or cast beyond it
So she spoke and the muchenduring goodly Odysseus was glad rejoicing that he saw a true friend in the lists
Then with a lighter heart he spoke among the Phaeacians
Reach this now young men
and presently methinks I will send another after it as far or even further
Of the rest if any mans heart and spirit bid him let him come hither and make trialfor ye have greatly angered mebe it in boxing or in wrestling aye or in running I care not let any one come of all the Phaeacians save Laodamas alone
For he is my host
and who would quarrel with one that entertains him
Foolish is that man and worthless who challenges to a contest the host who receives him in a strange land
he does but mar his own fortunes
But of all the rest I refuse none and make light of none but am fain to know them and make trial of them man to man
For in all things I am no weakling even in all the contests that are practised among men
Well do I know how to handle the polished bow
and ever would I be the first to shoot and smite my man in the throng of the foe even though many comrades stood by me and were shooting at the men
Only Philoctetes excelled me with the bow in the land of the Trojans when we Achaeans shot
But of all others I declare that I am best by far of all mortals that are now upon the earth and eat bread
Yet with men of former days I will not seek to vie with Heracles or with Eurytus of Oechalia  who strove even with the immortals in archery
Wherefore great Eurytus died soon nor did old age come upon him in his halls
for Apollo waxed wroth and slew him because he had challenged him to a contest with the bow
And with the spear I throw farther than any other man can shoot with an arrow
In the foot race alone I fear that someone of the Phaeacians may out strip me
for cruelly have I been broken amid the many waves since there was in my ship no lasting store of provisions
therefore my limbs are loosened
So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence
but Alcinous alone answered him and said
Stranger since not ungraciously dost thou speak thus in our midst but art minded to shew forth the prowess which waits upon thee in anger that yonder man came up to thee in the lists and taunted thee in a way in which no mortal would make light of thy prowess who knew in his heart how to speak fitly
come now hearken to my words that thou mayest tell to another hero when in thy halls thou art feasting with thy wife and children and rememberest our skill what feats Zeus has vouchsafed to us from our fathers days even until now
For we are not faultless boxers or wrestlers but in the foot race we run swiftly and we are the best seamen and ever to us is the banquet dear and the lyre and the dance and changes of raiment and warm baths and the couch
But come now all ye that are the best dancers of the Phaeacians make sport that the stranger may tell his friends on reaching home how far we surpass others in seamanship and in fleetness of foot and in the dance and in song
And let one go straightway and fetch for Demodocus the cleartoned lyre which lies somewhere in our halls
So spoke Alcinous the godlike and the herald rose to fetch the hollow lyre from the palace of the king
Then stood up masters of the lists nine in all men chosen from out the people who in their gatherings were wont to order all things aright
They levelled a place for the dance and marked out a fair wide ring and the herald came near bearing the cleartoned lyre for Demodocus
He then moved into the midst
and around him stood boys in the first bloom of youth well skilled in the dance and they smote the goodly dancing floor with their feet
And Odysseus gazed at the twinklings of their feet and marvelled in spirit
But the minstrel struck the chords in prelude to his sweet lay and sang of the love of Ares and Aphrodite of the fair crown how first they lay together in the house of Hephaestus secretly and Ares gave her many gifts and shamed the bed of the lord Hephaestus
But straightway one came to him with tidings even Helius who had marked them as they lay together in love
And when Hephaestus heard the grievous tale he went his way to his smithy pondering evil in the deep of his heart and set on the anvil block the great anvil and forged bonds which might not be broken or loosed that the lovers 1 might bide fast where they were
But when he had fashioned the snare in his wrath against Ares he went to his chamber where lay his bed
and everywhere round about the bedposts he spread the bonds and many too were hung from above from the roofbeams fine as spiders webs so that no one even of the blessed gods could see them
so exceeding craftily were they fashioned
But when he had spread all his snare about the couch he made as though he would go to Lemnos  that wellbuilt citadel which is in his eyes far the dearest of all lands
And no blind watch did Ares of the golden rein keep when he saw Hephaestus famed for his handicraft departing but he went his way to the house of famous Hephaestus
eager for the love of Cytherea of the fair crown
Now she had but newly come from the presence of her father the mighty son of Cronos and had sat her down
And Ares came into the house and clasped her hand and spoke and addressed her
Come love let us to bed and take our joy couched together
For Hephaestus is no longer here in the land but has now gone I ween to Lemnos  to visit the Sintians of savage speech
So he spoke and a welcome thing it seemed to her to lie with him
So they two went to the couch and lay them down to sleep
and about them clung the cunning bonds of the wise Hephaestus nor could they in any wise stir their limbs or raise them up
Then at length they learned that there was no more escaping
And near to them came the famous god of the two strong arms 1 having turned back before he reached the land of Lemnos 
for Helius had kept watch for him and had brought him word
So he went to his house with a heavy heart
and he stood at the gateway and fierce anger seized him
And terribly he cried out and called to all the gods
Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are forever come hither that ye may see a laughable matter and a monstrous 1 even how Aphrodite daughter of Zeus scorns me for that I am lame and loves destructive Ares because he is comely and strong of limb whereas I was born misshapen
Yet for this is none other to blame but my two parentswould they had never begotten me
But ye shall see where these two have gone up into my bed and sleep together in love and I am troubled at the sight
Yet methinks they will not wish to lie longer thus no not for a moment how loving soever they are
Soon shall both lose their desire to sleep
but the snare and the bonds shall hold them until her father pays back to me all the gifts of wooing that I gave him for the sake of his shameless girl for his daughter is fair but bridles not her passion 2
So he spoke and the gods gathered to the house of the brazen floor 3
Poseidon came the earthenfolder and the helper Hermes came and the lord Apollo the archer god 4
Now the goddesses abode for shame each in her own house
but the gods the givers of good things stood in the gateway
and unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods as they saw the craft of wise Hephaestus
And thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor
Ill deeds thrive not
The slow catches the swift even as now Hephaestus slow though he is has outstripped Ares for all that he is the swiftest of the gods who hold Olympus 
Lame though he is he has caught him by craft wherefore Ares owes the fine of the adulterer
Thus they spoke to one another
But to Hermes the lord Apollo son of Zeus said
Hermes son of Zeus messenger giver of good things wouldst thou in sooth be willing even though ensnared with strong bonds to lie on a couch by the side of golden Aphrodite
Then the messenger Argeiphontes answered him
Would that this might befall lord Apollo thou archer god
that thrice as many bonds inextricable might clasp me about and ye gods aye and all the goddesses too might be looking on but that I might sleep by the side of golden Aphrodite
So he spoke and laughter arose among the immortal gods
Yet Poseidon laughed not but ever besought Hephaestus the famous craftsman to set Ares free
and he spoke and addressed him with winged words
Loose him
and I promise as thou biddest me that he shall himself pay thee all that is right in the presence of the immortal gods
Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him
Ask not this of me Poseidon thou earthenfolder
A sorry thing to be sure of is the surety for a sorry knave
How could I put thee in bonds among the immortal gods if Ares should avoid both the debt and the bonds and depart
Then again Poseidon the earthshaker answered him
Hephaestus even if Ares shall avoid the debt and flee away I will myself pay thee this
Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him
It may not be that I should say thee nay nor were it seemly
So saying the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds
and the two when they were freed from that bond so strong sprang up straightway And Ares departed to Thrace  but she the laughterloving Aphrodite went to Cyprus  to Paphos 
where is her demesne and fragrant altar
There the Graces bathed her and anointed her with immortal oil such as gleams 1 upon the gods that are forever
And they clothed her in lovely raiment a wonder to behold
This song the famous minstrel sang and Odysseus was glad at heart as he listened and so too were the Phaeacians of the long oars men famed for their ships
Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone for no one could vie with them
And when they had taken in their hands the beautiful ball of purple which wise Polybus had made for them the one would lean backward and toss it toward the shadowy clouds and the other would leap up from the earth and skilfully catch it before his feet touched the ground again
But when they had tried their skill in throwing the ball straight up the two fell to dancing on the bounteous earth ever tossing the ball to and fro
and the other youths stood in the lists and beat time and thereat a great din arose
Then to Alcinous spoke goodly Odysseus
Lord Alcinous renowned above all men 2 thou didst boast that thy dancers were the best and lo thy words are made good
amazement holds me as I look on them
So he spoke and the strong and mighty Alcinous was glad and straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians lovers of the oar
Hear me leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians
This stranger verily seems to me a man of understanding
Come then let us give him a gift of friendship as is fitting
for twelve glorious kings bear sway in our land as rulers and I myself am the thirteenth
Now do you each of the twelve bring a newly washed cloak and tunic and a talent of precious gold
and let us straightway bring all together that the stranger with our gifts in his hands may go to his supper glad at heart
And let Euryalus make amends to the stranger himself with words and with a gift for the word that he spoke was in no wise seemly
So he spoke and they all praised his words and bade that so it should be and sent forth every man a herald to fetch the gifts
And Euryalus in turn made answer and said
Lord Alcinous renowned above all men I will indeed make amends to the stranger as thou biddest me
I will give him this sword all of bronze whereon is a hilt of silver and a scabbard of newsawn ivory is wrought about it
and it shall be to him a thing of great worth
So saying he put into his hands the silverstudded sword and spoke and addressed him with winged words
Hail Sir stranger
Hbut if any word has been spoken that was harsh may the stormwinds straightway snatch it and bear it away
And for thyself may the gods grant thee to see thy wife and to come to thy native land for long time hast thou been suffering woes far from thy friends
And Odysseus of many wiles answered him
All hail to thee too friend and may the gods grant thee happiness
and mayest thou never hereafter miss this sword which thou hast given me making amends with gentle speech
He spoke and about his shoulders hung the silverstudded sword
And the sun set and the glorious gifts were brought him
These the lordly heralds bore to the palace of Alcinous
and the sons of peerless Alcinous took the beautiful gifts and set them before their honored mother
And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way and they came in and sat down on the high seats
Then to Arete spoke the mighty Alcinous
Bring hither wife a goodly chest the best thou hast
and thyself place in it a newlywashed cloak and tunic
A and do ye heat for the stranger a cauldron on the fire and warm water that when he has bathed and has seen well bestowed all the gifts which the noble Phaeacians have brought hither he may take pleasure in the feast and in hearing the strains of the song
And I will give him this beautiful cup of mine wrought of gold that he may remember me all his days as he pours libations in his halls to Zeus and to the other gods
So he spoke and Arete bade her handmaids to set a great cauldron on the fire with all speed
And they set on the blazing fire the cauldron for filling the bath and poured in water and took billets of wood and kindled them beneath it
Then the fire played about the belly of the cauldron and the water grew warm
A but meanwhile Arete brought forth for the stranger a beautiful chest from the treasure chamber and placed in it the goodly gifts the raiment and the gold which the Phaeacians gave
And therein she herself placed a cloak and a fair tunic and she spoke and addressed Odysseus with winged words
Look now thyself to the lid and quickly cast a cord upon it lest some one despoil thee of thy goods on the way when later on 1 thou art lying in sweet sleep as thou farest in the black ship
Now when the muchenduring goodly Odysseus heard these words he straightway fitted on the lid and quickly cast a cord upon ita cunning knot which queenly Circe once had taught him
Then forthwith the housewife bade him go to the bath and bathe
and his heart was glad when he saw the warm bath for he had not been wont to have such tendance from the time that he left the house of fairedhaired Calypso
but until then he had tendance continually as a god
Now when the handmaids had bathed him and anointed him with oil and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic he came forth from the bath and went to join the men at their wine
And Nausicaa gifted with beauty by the gods stood by the doorpost of the wellbuilt hall and she marvelled at Odysseus as her eyes beheld him and she spoke and addressed him with winged words
Farewell stranger and hereafter even in thy own native land mayest thou remember me for to me first thou owest the price of thy life
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her
Nausicaa daughter of greathearted Alcinous so may Zeus grant the loudthundering lord of Here that I may reach my home and see the day of my returning
Then will I even there pray to thee as to a god all my days
for thou maiden hast given me life
He spoke and sat down on a chair beside king Alcinous
And now they were serving out portions and mixing the wine
Then the herald came near leading the good minstrel Demodocus held in honor by the people
and seated him in the midst of the banqueters leaning his chair against a high pillar
Then to the herald said Odysseus of many wiles cutting off a portion of the chine of a whitetusked boar whereof yet more was left and there was rich fat on either side
Herald take and give this portion to Demodocus that he may eat
and I will greet him despite my grief
For among all men that are upon the earth minstrels win honor and reverence for that the Muse has taught them the paths of song and loves the tribe of minstrels
So he spoke and the herald bore the portion and placed it in the hands of the lord Demodocus
and he took it and was glad at heart
So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink then to Demodocus said Odysseus of many wiles
Demodocus verily above all mortal men do I praise thee
whether it was the Muse the daughter of Zeus that taught thee or Apollo
for well and truly dost thou sing of the fate of the Achaeans all that they wrought and suffered and all the toils they endured as though haply thou hadst thyself been present or hadst heard the tale from another
But come now change thy theme and sing of the building of the horse of wood which Epeius made with Athenas help the horse which once Odysseus led up into the citadel as a thing of guile when he had filled it with the men who sacked Ilios 
If thou dost indeed tell me this tale aright I will declare to all mankind that the god has of a ready heart granted thee the gift of divine song
So he spoke and the minstrel moved by the god began and let his song be heard taking up the tale where the Argives had embarked on their benched ships and were sailing away after casting fire on their huts while those others led by glorious Odysseus were now sitting in the place of assembly of the Trojans hidden in the horse
for the Trojans had themselves dragged it to the citadel
So there it stood while the people talked long as they sat about it and could form no resolve
Nay in three ways did counsel find favour in their minds either to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless bronze or to drag it to the height and cast it down the rocks or to let it stand as a great offering to propitiate the gods even as in the end it was to be brought to pass
for it was their fate to perish when their city should enclose the great horse of wood wherein were sitting all the best of the Argives bearing to the Trojans death and fate
And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans poured forth from the horse and leaving their hollow ambush sacked the city
Of the others he sang how in divers ways they wasted the lofty city but of Odysseus how he went like Ares to the house of Deiphobus together with godlike Menelaus
There it was he said that Odysseus braved the most terrible fight and in the end conquered by the aid of greathearted Athena
This song the famous minstrel sang
But the heart of Odysseus was melted and tears wet his cheeks beneath his eyelids
And as a woman wails and flings herself about her dear husband who has fallen in front of his city and his people seeking toward off from his city and his children the pitiless day
and as she beholds him dying and gasping for breath she clings to him and shrieks aloud
while the foe behind her smite her back and shoulders with their spears and lead her away to captivity to bear toil and woe
while with most pitiful grief her cheeks are wasted
even so did Odysseus let fall pitiful tears from beneath his brows
Now from all the rest he concealed the tears that he shed but Alcinous alone marked him and took heed for he sat by him and heard him groaning heavily
And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians lovers of the oar
Hear me leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians and let Demodocus now check his cleartoned lyre
for in no wise to all alike does he give pleasure with this song
Ever since we began to sup and the divine minstrel was moved to sing from that time yon stranger has never ceased from sorrowful lamentation
surely methinks grief has encompassed his heart
Nay let the minstrel cease that we may all make merry hosts and guest alike since it is better thus
Lo for the sake of the honored stranger all these things have been made ready his sending and the gifts of friendship which we give him of our love
Dear as a brother is the stranger and the suppliant to a man whose wits have never so short a range
Therefore do not thou longer hide with crafty thought whatever I shall ask thee
to speak out plainly is the better course
Tell me the name by which they were wont to call thee in thy home even thy mother and thy father and other folk besides thy townsmen and the dwellers round about
For there is no one of all mankind who is nameless be he base man or noble when once he has been born but parents bestow names on all when they give them birth
And tell me thy country
thy people and thy city that our ships may convey thee thither discerning the course by their wits
For the Phaeacians have no pilots nor steeringoars such as other ships have
For but their ships of themselves understand the thoughts and minds of men and they know the cities and rich fields of all peoples and most swiftly do they cross over the gulf of the sea hidden in mist and cloud
nor ever have they fear of harm or ruin
Yet this story I once heard thus told by my father Nausithous who was wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because we give safe convoy to all men
He said that someday as a wellbuilt ship of the Phaeacians was returning from a convoy over the misty deep Poseidon would smite her and would fling a great mountain about our city 1
So that old man spoke
and these things the god will haply bring to pass or will leave unfulfilled as may be his good pleasure
But come now tell me this and declare it truly whither thou hast wandered and to what countries of men thou hast come tell me of the people and of their wellbuilt cities both of those who are cruel and wild and unjust and of those who love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts
And tell me why thou dost weep and wail in spirit as thou hearest the doom of the Argive Danaans and of Ilios 
This the gods wrought and spun the skein of ruin for men that there might be a song for those yet to be born
Did some kinsman of thine fall before Ilios  some good true man thy daughters husband or thy wifes father such as are nearest to one after ones own kin and blood
Or was it haply some comrade dear to thy heart some good true man
For no whit worse than a brother is a comrade who has an understanding heart
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said
Lord Alcinous renowned above all men verily this is a good thing to listen to a minstrel such as this man is like unto the gods in voice
For myself I declare that there is no greater fulfillment of delight than when joy possesses a whole people and banqueters in the halls listen to a minstrel as they sit in order due and by them tables are laden with bread and meat and the cupbearer draws wine from the bowl and bears it round and pours it into the cups
This seems to my mind the fairest thing there is
But thy heart is turned to ask of my grievous woes that I may weep and groan the more
What then shall I tell thee first what last
for woes full many have the heavenly gods given me
First now will I tell my name that ye too may know it and that I hereafter when I have escaped from the pitiless day of doom may be your host though I dwell in a home that is afar
I am Odysseus son of Laertes who am known among men for all manner of wiles 1 and my fame reaches unto heaven
But I dwell in clearseen Ithaca 
wherein is a mountain Neriton covered with waving forests conspicuous from afar
and round it lie many isles hard by one another Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus 
Ithaca itself lies close in to the mainland 1 the furthest toward the gloom 2 but the others lie apart toward the Dawn and the suna rugged isle but a good nurse of young men
and for myself no other thing can I see sweeter than ones own land
Of a truth Calypso the beautiful goddess sought to keep me by her in her hollow caves yearning that I should be her husband
and in like manner Circe would fain have held me back in her halls the guileful lady of Aeaea yearning that I should be her husband
but they could never persuade the heart within my breast
So true is it that naught is sweeter than a mans own land and his parents even though it be in a rich house that he dwells afar in a foreign land away from his parents
But come let me tell thee also of my woeful homecoming which Zeus laid upon me as I came from Troy 
From Ilios the wind bore me and brought me to the Cicones to Ismarus
There I sacked the city and slew the men
and from the city we took their wives and great store of treasure and divided them among us that so far as lay in me no man might go defrauded of an equal share
Then verily I gave command that we should flee with swift foot but the others in their great folly did not hearken
But there much wine was drunk and many sheep they slew by the shore and sleek kine of shambling gait
Meanwhile the Cicones went and called to other Cicones who were their neighbors at once more numerous and braver than theymen that dwelt inland and were skilled at fighting with their foes from chariots and if need were on foot
So they came in the morning as thick as leaves or flowers spring up in their season
and then it was that an evil fate from Zeus beset us luckless men that we might suffer woes full many
They set their battle in array and fought by the swift ships and each side hurled at the other with bronzetipped spears
Now as long as it was morn and the sacred day was waxing so long we held our ground and beat them off though they were more than we
But when the sun turned to the time for the unyoking of oxen then the Cicones prevailed and routed the Achaeans
and six of my wellgreaved comrades perished from each ship
but the rest of us escaped death and fate
Thence we sailed on grieved at heart glad to have escaped from death though we had lost our dear comrades
nor did I let my curved ships pass on till we had called thrice on each of those hapless comrades of ours who died on the plain cut down by the Cicones
But against our ships Zeus the cloudgatherer roused the North Wind with a wondrous tempest and hid with clouds the land and the sea alike
and night rushed down from heaven
Then the ships were driven headlong and their sails were torn to shreds by the violence of the wind
So we lowered the sails and stowed them aboard in fear of death and rowed the ships hurriedly toward the land
There for two nights and two days continuously we lay eating our hearts for weariness and sorrow
But when now fairtressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day we set up the masts and hoisted the white sails and took our seats and the wind and the helmsmen steered the ships
And now all unscathed should I have reached my native land
but the wave and the current and the North Wind beat me back as I was rounding Malea and drove me from my course past Cythera 
Thence for nine days space I was borne by direful winds over the teeming deep
but on the tenth we set foot on the land of the Lotuseaters who eat a flowery food
There we went on shore and drew water and straightway my comrades took their meal by the swift ships
But when we had tasted food and drink I sent forth some of my comrades to go and learn who the men were who here ate bread upon the earth two men I chose sending with them a third as a herald
So they went straightway and mingled with the Lotuseaters
and the Lotuseaters did not plan death for my comrades but gave them of the lotus to taste
And whosoever of them ate of the honeysweet fruit of the lotus had no longer any wish to bring back word or to return but there they were fain to abide among the Lotuseaters feeding on the lotus and forgetful of their homeward way
These men therefore I brought back perforce to the ships weeping and dragged them beneath the benches and bound them fast in the hollow ships
and I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to embark with speed on the swift ships lest perchance anyone should eat of the lotus and forget his homeward way
So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars
Thence we sailed on grieved at heart
and we came to the land of the Cyclopes an overweening and lawless folk who trusting in the immortal gods plant nothing with their hands nor plough but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing wheat and barley and vines which bear the rich clusters of wine and the rain of Zeus gives them increase
Neither assemblies for council have they nor appointed laws but they dwell on the peaks of lofty mountains in hollow caves and each one is lawgiver to his children and his wives and they reck nothing one of another
Now there is a level 1 isle that stretches aslant outside the harbor neither close to the shore of the land of the Cyclopes nor yet far off a wooded isle
Therein live wild goats innumerable for the tread of men scares them not away
nor are hunters wont to come thither men who endure toils in the woodland as they course over the peaks of the mountains
Neither with flocks is it held nor with ploughed lands but unsown and untilled all the days it knows naught of men but feeds the bleating goats
For the Cyclopes have at hand no ships with vermilion cheeks 2 nor are there shipwrights in their land who might build them wellbenched ships which should perform all their wants passing to the cities of other folk as men often cross the sea in ships to visit one another
craftsmen who would have made of this isle also a fair settlement
For the isle is nowise poor but would bear all things in season
In it are meadows by the shores of the grey sea wellwatered meadows and soft
where vines would never fail
and in it level ploughland
whence they might reap from season to season harvests exceeding deep so rich is the soil beneath
and in it too is a harbor giving safe anchorage where there is no need of moorings either to throw out anchorstones or to make fast stern cables but one may beach ones ship and wait until the sailors minds bid them put out and the breezes blow fair
Now at the head of the harbor a spring of bright water flows forth from beneath a cave
and round about it poplars grow
Thither we sailed in and some god guided us through the murky night for there was no light to see
but a mist lay deep about the ships and the moon showed no light from heaven but was shut in by clouds
Then no mans eyes beheld that island nor did we see the long waves rolling on the beach until we ran our wellbenched ships on shore
And when we had beached the ships we lowered all the sails and ourselves went forth on the shore of the sea
and there we fell asleep and waited for the bright Dawn
As soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered we roamed throughout the isle marvelling at it
and the nymphs the daughters of Zeus who bears the aegis roused the mountain goats that my comrades might have whereof to make their meal
Straightway we took from the ships our curved bows and long javelins and arrayed in three bands we fell to smiting
and the god soon gave us game to satisfy our hearts
The ships that followed me were twelve and to each nine goats fell by lot
but for me alone they chose out ten
So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine
For not yet was the red wine spent from out our ships but some was still left
for abundant store had we drawn in jars for each crew
when we took the sacred citadel of the Cicones
And we looked across to the land of the Cyclopes who dwelt close at hand and marked the smoke and the voice of men and of the sheep and of the goats
But when the sun set and darkness came on then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea
And as soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered I called my men together and spoke among them all
Remain here now all the rest of you my trusty comrades
but I with my own ship and my own company will go and make trial of yonder men to learn who they are whether they are cruel and wild and unjust or whether they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts
So saying I went on board the ship and bade my comrades themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables
So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars
But when we had reached the place which lay close at hand there on the lands edge hard by the sea we saw a high cave roofed over with laurels
and there many flocks sheep and goats alike were wont to sleep
Round about it a high court was built with stones set deep in the earth and with tall pines and highcrested oaks
There a monstrous man was wont to sleep who shepherded his flocks alone and afar
and mingled not with others but lived apart with his heart set on lawlessness
For he was fashioned a wondrous monster and was not like a man that lives by bread but like a wooded peak of lofty mountains which stands out to view alone apart from the rest
Then I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to remain there by the ship and to guard the ship but I chose twelve of the best of my comrades and went my way
With me I had a goatskin of the dark sweet wine which Maro son of Euanthes had given me the priest of Apollo the god who used to watch over Ismarus And he had given it me because we had protected him with his child and wife out of reverence
for he dwelt in a wooded grove of Phoebus Apollo
And he gave me splendid gifts
of wellwrought gold he gave me seven talents and he gave me a mixingbowl all of silver and besides these wine wherewith he filled twelve jars in all wine sweet and unmixed a drink divine
Not one of his slaves nor of the maids in his halls knew thereof but himself and his dear wife and one housedame only
And as often as they drank that honeysweet red wine he would fill one cup and pour it into twenty measures of water and a smell would rise from the mixingbowl marvellously sweet
then verily would one not choose to hold back
With this wine I filled and took with me a great skin and also provision in a scrip
for my proud spirit had a foreboding that presently a man would come to me clothed in great might a savage man that knew naught of justice or of law 1
Speedily we came to the cave nor did we find him within but he was pasturing his fat flocks in the fields
So we entered the cave and gazed in wonder at all things there
The crates were laden with cheeses and the pens were crowded with lambs and kids
Each kind was penned separately by themselves the firstlings by themselves the later lambs and by themselves again the newly weaned
And with whey were swimming all the wellwrought vessels the milkpails and the bowls into which he milked
Then my comrades spoke and besought me first of all to take of the cheeses and depart and thereafter speedily to drive to the swift ship the kids and lambs from out the pens and to sail over the salt water
But I did not listen to themverily it would have been better farto the end that I might see the man himself and whether he would give me gifts of entertainment
Yet as it fell his appearing was not to prove a joy to my comrades
Then we kindled a fire and offered sacrifice and ourselves too took of the cheeses and ate and thus we sat in the cave and waited for him until he came back herding his flocks
He bore a mighty weight of dry wood to serve him at supper time and flung it down with a crash inside the cave
but we seized with terror shrank back into a recess of the cave
But he drove his fat flocks into the wide cavernall those that he milked but the malesthe rams and the goatshe left without in the deep court 1
Then he lifted on high and set in place the great doorstone a mighty rock
two and twenty stout fourwheeled wagons could not lift it from the ground
such a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway
Thereafter he sat down and milked the ewes and bleating goats all in turn and beneath each dam he placed her young
Then presently he curdled half the white milk and gathered it in wicker baskets and laid it away and the other half he set in vessels that he might have it to take and drink and that it might serve him for supper
But when he had busily performed his tasks then he rekindled the fire and caught sight of us and asked
Strangers who are ye
Whence do ye sail over the watery ways
Is it on some business or do ye wander at random over the sea even as pirates who wander hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands
So he spoke and in our breasts our spirit was broken for terror of his deep voice and monstrous self
yet even so I made answer and spoke to him saying
We thou must know are from Troy  Achaeans driven wandering by all manner of winds over the great gulf of the sea Seeking our home we have come by another way by other paths
so I ween Zeus was pleased to devise
And we declare that we are the men of Agamemnon son of Atreus whose fame is now mightiest under heaven
so great a city did he sack and slew many people
but we on our part thus visiting thee have come as suppliants to thy knees in the hope that thou wilt give us entertainment or in other wise make some present as is the due of strangers
Nay mightiest one reverence the gods
we are thy suppliants and Zeus is the avenger of suppliants and strangersZeus the strangers godwho ever attends upon reverend strangers
So I spoke and he straightway made answer with pitiless heart
A fool art thou stranger or art come from afar seeing that thou biddest me either to fear or to shun the gods
For the Cyclopes reck not of Zeus who bears the aegis nor of the blessed gods since verily we are better far than they
Nor would I to shun the wrath of Zeus spare either thee or thy comrades unless my own heart should bid me
But tell me where thou didst moor thy wellwrought ship on thy coming Was it haply at a remote part of the land or close by I fain would know
So he spoke tempting me but he trapped me not because of my great cunning and I made answer again in crafty words
My ship Poseidon the earthshaker dashed to pieces casting her upon the rocks at the border of your land for he brought her close to the headland
and the wind drove her in from the sea
But I with these men here escaped utter destruction
So I spoke but from his pitiless heart he made no answer but sprang up and put forth his hands upon my comrades Two of them at once he seized and to the earth like puppies dashed
And the brain flowed forth upon the ground and wetted the earth
Then he cut them limb from limb and made ready his supper
and ate them as a mountainnurtured lion leaving naughtate the entrails and the flesh and the marrowy bones
And we with wailing held up our hands to Zeus beholding his cruel deeds and helplessness possessed our souls
But when the Cyclops had filled his huge maw by eating human flesh and thereafter drinking pure milk he lay down within the cave stretched out among the sheep
And I formed a plan in my great heart to steal near him and draw my sharp sword from beside my thigh and smite him in the breast where the midriff holds the liver feeling for the place with my hand
But a second thought checked me
for right there should we too have perished in utter ruin
For we should not have been able to thrust back with our hands from the high door the mighty stone which he had set there
So then with wailing we waited for the bright Dawn
As soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered he rekindled the fire and milked his goodly flocks all in turn and beneath each dam placed her young
Then when he had busily performed his tasks again he seized two men at once and made ready his meal
And when he had made his meal he drove his fat flocks forth from the cave easily moving away the great doorstone
and then he put it in place again as one might set the lid upon a quiver
Then with loud whistling the Cyclops turned his fat flocks toward the mountain
and I was left there devising evil in the deep of my heart if in any way I might take vengeance on him and Athena grant me glory
Now this seemed to my mind the best plan
There lay beside a sheeppen a great club of the Cyclops a staff of green olivewood
which he had cut to carry with him when dry
and as we looked at it we thought it as large as is the mast of a black ship of twenty oars a merchantman broad of beam which crosses over the great gulf
so huge it was in length and in breadth to look upon
To this I came and cut off therefrom about a fathoms length and handed it to my comrades bidding them dress it down
and they made it smooth
and I standing by sharpened it at the point and then straightway took it and hardened it in the blazing fire
Then I laid it carefully away hiding it beneath the dung which lay in great heaps throughout the cave
And I bade my comrades cast lots among them which of them should have the hardihood with me to lift the stake and grind it into his eye when sweet sleep should come upon him
And the lot fell upon those whom I myself would fain have chosen four they were and I was numbered with them as the fifth
At even then he came herding his flocks of goodly fleece
and straightway drove into the wide cave his fat flocks one and all and left not one without in the deep court either from some foreboding or because a god so bade him
Then he lifted on high and set in place the great doorstone and sitting down he milked the ewes and bleating goats all in turn and beneath each dam he placed her young
But when he had busily performed his tasks again he seized two men at once and made ready his supper
Then I drew near and spoke to the Cyclops holding in my hands an ivy 1 bowl of the dark wine
Cyclops take and drink wine after thy meal of human flesh that thou mayest know what manner of drink this is which our ship contained
It was to thee that I was bringing it as a drink offering in the hope that touched with pity thou mightest send me on my way home
but thou ragest in a way that is past all bearing
Cruel man how shall any one of all the multitudes of men ever come to thee again hereafter seeing that thou hast wrought lawlessness
So I spoke and he took the cup and drained it
and was wondrously pleased as he drank the sweet draught and asked me for it again a second time
Give it me again with a ready heart and tell me thy name straightway that I may give thee a strangers gift whereat thou mayest be glad
For among the Cyclopes the earth the giver of grain bears the rich clusters of wine and the rain of Zeus gives them increase
but this is a streamlet of ambrosia and nectar
So he spoke and again I handed him the flaming wine
Thrice I brought and gave it him and thrice he drained it in his folly
But when the wine had stolen about the wits of the Cyclops then I spoke to him with gentle words
Cyclops thou askest me of my glorious name and I will tell it thee
and do thou give me a strangers gift even as thou didst promise
Noman is my name
Noman do they call memy mother and my father and all my comrades as well
So I spoke and he straightway answered me with pitiless heart
Noman will I eat last among his comrades and the others before him
this shall be thy gift
He spoke and reeling fell upon his back and lay there with his thick neck bent aslant and sleep that conquers all laid hold on him
And from his gullet came forth wine and bits of human flesh
and he vomited in his drunken sleep
Then verily I thrust in the stake under the deep ashes until it should grow hot
and heartened all my comrades with cheering words that I might see no man flinch through fear
But when presently that stake of olivewood was about to catch fire green though it was and began to glow terribly then verily I drew nigh bringing the stake from the fire and my comrades stood round me
and a god breathed into us great courage
They took the stake of olivewood sharp at the point and thrust it into his eye
while I throwing my weight upon it from above whirled it round as when a man bores a ships timber with a drill while those below keep it spinning with the thong which they lay hold of by either end and the drill runs around unceasingly
Even so we took the fierypointed stake and whirled it around in his eye and the blood flowed around the heated thing
And his eyelids wholly and his brows round about did the flame singe as the eyeball burned and its roots crackled in the fire
And as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in cold water amid loud hissing to temper it
for therefrom comes the strength of iron even so did his eye hiss round the stake of olivewood
Terribly then did he cry aloud and the rock rang around and we seized with terror shrank back
while he wrenched from his eye the stake all befouled with blood
and flung it from him wildly waving his arms Then he called aloud to the Cyclopes who dwelt round about him in caves among the windy heights
and they heard his cry and came thronging from every side and standing around the cave asked him what ailed him
What so sore distress is thine Polyphemus that thou criest out thus through the immortal night and makest us sleepless
Can it be that some mortal man is driving off thy flocks against thy will
or slaying thee thyself by guile or by might
Then from out the cave the mighty Polyphemus answered them
My friends it is Noman that is slaying me by guile and not by force
And they made answer and addressed him with winged words
If then no man does violence to thee in thy loneliness sickness which comes from great Zeus thou mayest in no wise escape Nay do thou pray to our father the lord Poseidon
So they spoke and went their way and my heart laughed within me that my name and cunning device had so beguiled
But the Cyclops groaning and travailing in anguish groped with his hands and took away the stone from the door and himself sat in the doorway with arms outstretched in the hope of catching anyone who sought to go forth with the sheep
so witless forsooth he thought in his heart to find me
But I took counsel how all might be the very best if I might haply find some way of escape from death for my comrades and for myself
And I wove all manner of wiles and counsel as a man will in a matter of life and death
for great was the evil that was nigh us
And this seemed to my mind the best plan
Rams there were wellfed and thick of fleece fine beasts and large with wool dark as the violet
These I silently bound together with twisted withes on which the Cyclops that monster with his heart set on lawlessness was wont to sleep Three at a time I took
The one in the middle in each case bore a man and the other two went one on either side saving my comrades
Thus every three sheep bore a man
But as for methere was a ram far the best of all the flock
him I grasped by the back and curled beneath his shaggy belly lay there face upwards with steadfast heart clinging fast with my hands to his wondrous fleece
So then with wailing we waited for the bright dawn
As soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered then the males of the flock hastened forth to pasture and the females bleated unmilked about the pens
for their udders were bursting
And their master distressed with grievous pains felt along the backs of all the sheep as they stood up before him
but in his folly he marked not this that my men were bound beneath the breasts of his fleecy sheep
Last of all the flock the ram went forth burdened with the weight of his fleece and my cunning self
And mighty Polyphemus as he felt along his back spoke to him saying
Good ram why pray is it that thou goest forth thus through the cave the last of the flock
Thou hast not heretofore been wont to lag behind the sheep but wast ever far the first to feed on the tender bloom of the grass moving with long strides and ever the first didst reach the streams of the river and the first didst long to return to the fold at evening
But now thou art last of all
Surely thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy master which an evil man blinded along with his miserable fellows when he had overpowered my wits with wine even Noman who I tell thee has not yet escaped destruction
If only thou couldst feel as I do and couldst get thee power of speech to tell me where he skulks away from my wrath
then should his brains be dashed on the ground here and there throughout the cave when I had smitten him and my heart should be lightened of the woes which goodfornaught Noman has brought me
So saying he sent the ram forth from him
And when we had gone a little way from the cave and the court I first loosed myself from under the ram and set my comrades free
Speedily then we drove off those longshanked sheep rich with fat turning full often to look about until we came to the ship
And welcome to our dear comrades was the sight of us who had escaped death but for the others they wept and wailed
yet I would not suffer them to weep but with a frown forbade each man Rather I bade them to fling on board with speed the many sheep of goodly fleece and sail over the salt water
So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars
But when I was as far away as a mans voice carries when he shouts then I spoke to the Cyclops with mocking words
Cyclops that man it seems was no weakling whose comrades thou wast minded to devour by brutal strength in thy hollow cave
Full surely were thy evil deeds to fall on thine own head thou cruel wretch who didst not shrink from eating thy guests in thine own house
Therefore has Zeus taken vengeance on thee and the other gods
So I spoke and he waxed the more wroth at heart and broke off the peak of a high mountain and hurled it at us and cast it in front of the darkprowed ship 1
And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell and the backward flow like a flood from the deep bore the ship swiftly landwards and drove it upon the shore
But I seized a long pole in my hands and shoved the ship off and along the shore and with a nod of my head I roused my comrades and bade them fall to their oars that we might escape out of our evil plight
And they bent to their oars and rowed
But when as we fared over the sea we were twice as far distant then was I fain to call to the Cyclops
though round about me my comrades one after another sought to check me with gentle words
Reckless one why wilt thou provoke to wrath a savage man
who but now hurled his missile into the deep and drove our ship back to the land and verily we thought that we had perished there
And had he heard one of us uttering a sound or speaking he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our heads and the timbers of our ship
so mightily does he throw
So they spoke but they could not persuade my greathearted spirit and I answered him again with angry heart
Cyclops if any one of mortal men shall ask thee about the shameful blinding of thine eye say that Odysseus the sacker of cities blinded it even the son of Laertes whose home is in Ithaca 
So I spoke and he groaned and said in answer
Lo now verily a prophecy uttered long ago is come upon me
There lived here a soothsayer a good man and tall Telemus son of Eurymus who excelled all men in soothsaying and grew old as a seer among the Cyclopes
He told me that all these things should be brought to pass in days to come that by the hands of Odysseus I should lose my sight
But I ever looked for some tall and comely man to come hither clothed in great might
but now one that is puny a man of naught and a weakling has blinded me of my eye when he had overpowered me with wine
Yet come hither Odysseus that I may set before thee gifts of entertainment and may speed thy sending hence that the glorious Earthshaker may grant it thee
For I am his son and he declares himself my father
and he himself will heal me if it be his good pleasure but none other either of the blessed gods or of mortal men
So he spoke in prayer and the darkhaired god heard him
But the Cyclops lifted on high again a far greater stone and swung and hurled it putting into the throw measureless strength He cast it a little behind the darkprowed ship and barely missed the end of the steeringoar
And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell
and the wave bore the ship onward and drove it to the shore
Now when we had come to the island where our other wellbenched ships lay all together and round about them our comrades ever expecting us sat weeping then on coming thither we beached our ship on the sands and ourselves went forth upon the shore of the sea
Then we took from out the hollow ship the flocks of the Cyclops and divided them that so far as in me lay no man might go defrauded of an equal share
But the ram my wellgreaved comrades gave to me alone when the flocks were divided as a gift apart
and on the shore I sacrificed him to Zeus son of Cronos god of the dark clouds who is lord of all and burned the thighpieces
Howbeit he heeded not my sacrifice but was planning how all my wellbenched ships might perish and my trusty comrades
So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine
but when the sun set and darkness came on then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea
And as soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered I roused my comrades and bade them themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables
So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars
Thence we sailed on grieved at heart glad to have escaped death though we had lost our dear comrades
Then to the Aeolian isle we came
where dwelt Aeolus son of Hippotas dear to the immortal gods in a floating island
and all around it is a wall of unbreakable bronze and the cliff runs up sheer
Twelve children of his too there are in the halls six daughters and six sturdy sons
and he gave his daughters to his sons to wife
These then feast continually by their dear father and good mother and before them lies boundless good cheer And the house filled with the savour of feasting resounds all about even in the outer court by day 1
and by night again they sleep beside their chaste wives on blankets and on corded bedsteads
To their city then and fair palace did we come
and for a full month he made me welcome and questioned me about each thing about Ilios  and the ships of the Argives and the return of the Achaeans
And I told him all the tale in due order
But when I on my part asked him that I might depart and bade him send me on my way he too denied me nothing but furthered my sending
He gave me a wallet made of the hide of an ox nine years old 2 which he flayed and therein he bound the paths of the blustering winds
for the son of Cronos had made him keeper of the winds both to still and to rouse whatever one he will
And in my hollow ship he bound it fast with a bright cord of silver that not a breath might escape were it never so slight
But for my furtherance he sent forth the breath of the West Wind to blow that it might bear on their way both ships and men
Yet this he was not to bring to pass
for we were lost through our own folly
For nine days we sailed night and day alike and now on the tenth our native land came in sight and lo we were so near that we saw men tending the beacon fires 1
Then upon me came sweet sleep in my weariness for I had ever kept in hand the sheet of the ship and had yielded it to none other of my comrades that we might the sooner come to our native land
But my comrades meanwhile began to speak one to another and said that I was bringing home for myself gold and silver as gifts from Aeolus the greathearted son of Hippotas
And thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor
Out on it how beloved and honored this man is by all men to whose city and land soever he comes
Much goodly treasure is he carrying with him from the land of Troy from out the spoil while we who have accomplished the same journey as he are returning bearing with us empty hands
And now Aeolus has given him these gifts granting them freely of his love
Nay come let us quickly see what is here what store of gold and silver is in the wallet
So they spoke and the evil counsel of my comrades prevailed
They loosed the wallet and all the winds leapt forth
and swiftly the stormwind seized them and bore them weeping out to sea away from their native land
but as for me I awoke and pondered in my goodly heart whether I should fling myself from the ship and perish in the sea or endure in silence and still remain among the living
However I endured and abode and covering my head lay down in the ship
But the ships were borne by an evil blast of wind back to the Aeolian isle and my comrades groaned
There we went ashore and drew water and straightway my comrades took their meal by the swift ships
But when we had tasted of food and drink I took with me a herald and one companion and went to the glorious palace of Aeolus
and I found him feasting beside his wife and his children
So we entered the house and sat down by the doorposts on the threshold
and they were amazed at heart and questioned us
How hast thou come hither Odysseus
What cruel god assailed thee
Surely we sent thee forth with kindly care that thou mightest reach thy native land and thy home and whatever place thou wouldest
So said they but I with a sorrowing heart spoke among them and said
Bane did my evil comrades work me and therewith sleep accursed
but bring ye healing my friends
for with you is the power
So I spoke and addressed them with gentle words but they were silent
Then their father answered and said
Begone from our island with speed thou vilest of all that live
In no wise may I help or send upon his way that man who is hated of the blessed gods
Begone for thou comest hither as one hated of the immortals
So saying he sent me forth from the house groaning heavily
Thence we sailed on grieved at heart
And worn was the spirit of the men by the grievous rowing because of our own folly for no longer appeared any breeze to bear us on our way
So for six days we sailed night and day alike and on the seventh we came to the lofty citadel of Lamus even to Telepylus of the Laestrygonians where herdsman calls to herdsman as he drives in his flock and the other answers as he drives his forth
There a man who never slept could have earned a double wage one by herding cattle and one by pasturing white sheep
for the out goings of the night and of the day are close together 1
When we had come thither into the goodly harbor about which on both sides a sheer cliff runs continuously and projecting headlands opposite to one another stretch out at the mouth and the entrance is narrow then all the rest steered their curved ships in
and the ships were moored within the hollow harbor close together
for therein no wave ever swelled great or small but all about was a bright calm
But I alone moored my black ship outside there on the border of the land making the cables fast to the rock
Then I climbed to a rugged height a point of outlook and there took my stand
from thence no works of oxen or of men appeared smoke alone we saw springing up from the land
So then I sent forth some of my comrades to go and learn who the men were who here ate bread upon the earthtwo men I chose and sent with them a third as a herald
Now when they had gone ashore they went along a smooth road by which wagons were wont to bring wood down to the city from the high mountains And before the city they met a maiden drawing water the goodly 1 daughter of Laestrygonian Antiphates
who had come down to the fairflowing spring Artacia
So from whence they were wont to bear water to the town
So they came up to her and spoke to her and asked her who was king of this folk and who they were of whom he was lord
And she showed them forth with the highroofed house of her father
Now when they had entered the glorious house they found there his wife huge as the peak of a mountain and they were aghast at her
At once she called from the place of assembly the glorious Antiphates her husband and he devised for them woeful destruction
Straightway he seized one of my comrades and made ready his meal
but the other two sprang up and came in flight to the ships
Then he raised a cry throughout the city
and as they heard it the mighty Laestrygonians came thronging from all sides a host past counting not like men but like the Giants
They hurled at us from the cliffs with rocks huge as a man could lift
and at once there rose throughout the ships a dreadful din alike from men that were dying and from ships that were being crushed
And spearing them like fishes they bore them home a loathly meal
Now while they were slaying those within the deep harbor I meanwhile drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh and cut therewith the cables of my darkprowed ship
and quickly calling to my comrades bade them fall to their oars that we might escape from out our evil plight
And they all tossed the sea with their oarblades in fear of death
and joyfully seaward away from the beetling cliffs my ship sped on
but all those other ships were lost together there
Thence we sailed on grieved at heart glad to have escaped death though we had lost our dear comrades
and we came to the isle of Aeaea
where dwelt fairtressed Circe a dread goddess of human speech own sister to Aeetes of baneful mind
and both are sprung from Helius who gives light to mortals and from Perse  their mother whom Oceanus begot
Here we put in to shore with our ship in silence into a harbor where ships may lie and some god guided us
Then we disembarked and lay there for two days and two nights eating our hearts for weariness and sorrow
But when fairtressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day then I took my spear and my sharp sword and quickly went up from the ship to a place of wide prospect in the hope that I might see the works of men and hear their voice
So I climbed to a rugged height a place of outlook and there took my stand and I saw smoke rising from the broadwayed earth in the halls of Circe through the thick brush and the wood
And I debated in mind and heart whether I should go and make search when I had seen the flaming smoke
And as I pondered this seemed to me to be the better way to go first to the swift ship and the shore of the sea and give my comrades their meal and send them forth to make search
But when as I went I was near to the curved ship then some god took pity on me in my loneliness and sent a great highhorned stag into my very path
He was coming down to the river from his pasture in the wood to drink
for the might of the sun oppressed him
and as he came out I struck him on the spine in the middle of the back
and the bronze spear passed right through him and down he fell in the dust with a moan and his spirit flew from him
Then I planted my foot upon him and drew the bronze spear forth from the wound
and left it there to lie on the ground
But for myself I plucked twigs and osiers and weaving a rope as it were a fathom in length well twisted from end to end I bound together the feet of the monstrous beast and went my way to the black ship bearing him across my back and leaning on my spear since in no wise could I hold him on my shoulder with one hand
for he was a very mighty beast
Down I flung him before the ship and heartened my comrades with gentle words coming up to each man in turn
Friends not yet shall we go down to the house of Hades despite our sorrows before the day of fate comes upon us
Nay come while there is yet food and drink in our swift ship let us bethink us of food that we pine not with hunger
So I spoke and they quickly hearkened to my words From their faces they drew their cloaks 1 and marvelled at the stag on the shore of the unresting sea
for he was a very mighty beast
But when they had satisfied their eyes with gazing they washed their hands and made ready a glorious feast
So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine
But when the sun set and darkness came on then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea
And as soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered I called my men together and spoke among them all
Hearken to my words comrades for all your evil plight
My friends we know not where the darkness is or where the dawn neither where the sun who give light to mortals goes beneath the earth nor where he rises
but let us straightway take thought if any device be still left us
As for me I think not that there is
For I climbed to a rugged point of outlook and beheld the island about which is set as a crown the boundless deep
The isle itself lies low
and in the midst of it my eyes saw smoke through the thick brush and the wood
So I spoke and their spirit was broken within them as they remembered the deeds of the Laestrygonian Antiphates and the violence of the greathearted Cyclops the maneater
And they wailed aloud and shed big tears
But no good came of their mourning
Then I told off in two bands all my wellgreaved comrades and appointed a leader for each band
Of the one I took command and of the other godlike Eurylochus
Quickly then we shook lots in a brazen helmet
and out leapt the lot of greathearted Eurylochus
So he set out and with him went twoandtwenty comrades all weeping
and they left us behind lamenting
Within the forest glades they found the house of Circe built of polished stone in a place of wide outlook 1
and round about it were mountain wolves and lions whom Circe herself had bewitched for she gave them evil drugs
Yet these beasts did not rush upon my men but pranced about them fawningly wagging their long tails
And as when hounds fawn around their master as he comes from a feast for he ever brings them bits to soothe their temper so about them fawned the stoutclawed wolves and lions
but they were seized with fear as they saw the dread monsters
So they stood in the gateway of the fairtressed goddess and within they heard Circe singing with sweet voice as she went to and fro before a great imperishable web such as is the handiwork of goddesses finelywoven and beautiful and glorious
Then among them spoke Polites a leader of men dearest to me of my comrades and trustiest
Friends within someone goes to and fro before a great web singing sweetly so that all the floor echoes some goddess it is or some woman
Come let us quickly call to her
So he spoke and they cried aloud and called to her
And she straightway came forth and opened the bright doors and bade them in
and all went with her in their folly
Only Eurylochus remained behind for he suspected that there was a snare
She brought them in and made them sit on chairs and seats and made for them a potion of cheese and barley meal and yellow honey with Pramnian wine
but in the food she mixed baneful drugs that they might utterly forget their native land
Now when she had given them the potion and they had drunk it off then she presently smote them with her wand and penned them in the sties
And they had the heads and voice and bristles and shape of swine but their minds remained unchanged even as before
So they were penned there weeping and before them Circe flung mast and acorns and the fruit of the cornel tree to eat such things as wallowing swine are wont to feed upon
But Eurylochus came back straightway to the swift black ship to bring tiding of his comrades and their shameful doom
Not a word could he utter for all his desire so stricken to the heart was he with great distress
and his eyes were filled with tears and his spirit was set on lamentation
But when we questioned him in amazement then he told the fate of the others his comrades
We went through the thickets as thou badest noble Odysseus
We found in the forest glades a fair palace built of polished stones in a place of wide outlook
There someone was going to and fro before a great web and singing with clear voice some goddess or some woman
and they cried aloud and called to her
And she came forth straightway and opened the bright doors and bade them in
and they all went with her in their folly
But I remained behind for I suspected that there was a snare
Then they all vanished together nor did one of them appear again
though I sat long and watched
So he spoke and I cast my silverstudded sword about my shoulders a great sword of bronze and slung my bow about me
and bade him lead me back by the selfsame road
But he clasped me with both hands and be sought me by my knees and with wailing he spoke to me winged words
Lead me not thither against my will O thou fostered of Zeus but leave me here
For I know that thou wilt neither come back thyself nor bring anyone of thy comrades
Nay with these that are here let us flee with all speed
for still we may haply escape the evil day
So he spoke but I answered him and said
Eurylochus do thou stay here in this place eating and drinking by the hollow black ship
but I will go for strong necessity is laid upon me
So saying I went up from the ship and the sea
But when as I went through the sacred glades I was about to come to the great house of the sorceress Circe then Hermes of the golden wand met me as I went toward the house in the likeness of a young man with the first down upon his lip in whom the charm of youth is fairest
He clasped my hand and spoke and addressed me
Whither now again hapless man dost thou go alone through the hills knowing naught of the country
Lo thy comrades yonder in the house of Circe are penned like swine in closebarred sties
And art thou come to release them
Nay I tell thee thou shalt not thyself return but shalt remain there with the others
But come I will free thee from harm and save thee
Here take this potent herb and go to the house of Circe and it shall ward off from thy head the evil day
And I will tell thee all the baneful wiles of Circe
She will mix thee a potion and cast drugs into the food
but even so she shall not be able to bewitch thee for the potent herb that I shall give thee will not suffer it
And I will tell thee all
When Circe shall smite thee with her long wand then do thou draw thy sharp sword from beside thy thigh and rush upon Circe as though thou wouldst slay her
And she will be seized with fear and will bid thee lie with her
Then do not thou thereafter refuse the couch of the goddess that she may set free thy comrades and give entertainment to thee
But bid her swear a great oath by the blessed gods that she will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt lest when she has thee stripped she may render thee a weakling and unmanned
So saying Argeiphontes gave me the herb drawing it from the ground and showed me its nature
At the root it was black but its flower was like milk
Moly the gods call it
and it is hard for mortal men to dig but with the gods all things are possible
Hermes then departed to high Olympus through the wooded isle and I went my way to the house of Circe and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went
So I stood at the gates of the fairtressed goddess
There I stood and called and the goddess heard my voice
Straightway then she came forth and opened the bright doors and bade me in
and I went with her my heart sore troubled
She brought me in and made me sit on a silverstudded chair a beautiful chair richly wrought
and beneath was a footstool for the feet
And she prepared me a potion in a golden cup that I might drink and put therein a drug with evil purpose in her heart
But when she had given it me and I had drunk it off yet was not bewitched she smote me with her wand and spoke and addressed me
Begone now to the sty and lie with the rest of thy comrades
So she spoke but I drawing my sharp sword from beside my thigh rushed upon Circe as though I would slay her
But she with a loud cry ran beneath and clasped my knees and with wailing she spoke to me winged words
Who art thou among men and from whence
Where is thy city and where thy parents
Amazement holds me that thou hast drunk this charm and wast in no wise bewitched
For no man else soever hath withstood this charm when once he has drunk it and it has passed the barrier of his teeth
Nay but the mind in thy breast is one not to be beguiled
Surely thou art Odysseus the man of ready device who Argeiphontes of the golden wand ever said to me would come hither on his way home from Troy with his swift black ship
Nay come put up thy sword in its sheath and let us two then go up into my bed that couched together in love we may put trust in each other
So she spoke but I answered her and said
Circe how canst thou bid me be gentle to thee who hast turned my comrades into swine in thy halls and now keepest me here and with guileful purpose biddest me go to thy chamber and go up into thy bed that when thou hast me stripped thou mayest render me a weakling and unmanned
Nay verily it is not I that shall be fain to go up into thy bed unless thou goddess wilt consent to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt
So I spoke and she straightway swore the oath to do me no harm as I bade her
But when she had sworn and made an end of the oath then I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe
But her handmaids meanwhile were busied in the halls four maidens who are her servingwomen in the house
Children are they of the springs and groves and of the sacred rivers that flow forth to the sea
and of them one threw upon chairs fair rugs of purple above and spread beneath them a linen cloth
another drew up before the chairs tables of silver and set upon them golden baskets
and the third mixed sweet honeyhearted wine in a bowl of silver and served out golden cups
and the fourth brought water and kindled a great fire beneath a large cauldron
and the water grew warm
But when the water boiled in the bright bronze she set me in a bath and bathed me with water from out the great cauldron mixing it to my liking and pouring it over my head and shoulders till she took from my limbs soulconsuming weariness
But when she had bathed me and anointed me richly with oil and had cast about me a fair cloak and a tunic she brought me into the hall and made me sit upon a silverstudded chaira beautiful chair richly wrought and beneath was a footstool for the feet
Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold and poured it over a silver basin for me to wash
and beside me drew up a polished table
And the grave housewife brought and set before me bread and therewith meats in abundance granting freely of her store
Then she bade me eat but my heart inclined not thereto
Rather I sat with other thoughts and my spirit boded ill
Now when Circe noted that I sat thus and did not put forth my hands to the food but was burdened with sore grief she came close to me and spoke winged words
Why Odysseus dost thou sit thus like one that is dumb eating thy heart and dost not touch food or drink
Dost thou haply forbode some other guile
Nay thou needest in no wise fear
for already have I sworn a mighty oath to do thee no harm
So she spoke but I answered her and said
Circe what man that is rightminded could bring himself to taste of food or drink ere yet he had won freedom for his comrades and beheld them before his face
But if thou of a ready heart dost bid me eat and drink set them free that mine eyes may behold my trusty comrades
So I spoke and Circe went forth through the hall holding her wand in her hand and opened the doors of the sty and drove them out in the form of swine of nine years old
So they stood there before her and she went through the midst of them and anointed each man with another charm
Then from their limbs the bristles fell away which the baneful drug that queenly Circe gave them had before made to grow
and they became men again younger than they were before and far comelier and taller to look upon
They knew me and clung to my hands each man of them
and upon them all came a passionate sobbing and the house about them rang wondrously
and the goddess herself was moved to pity
Then the beautiful goddess drew near me and said
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices go now to thy swift ship and to the shore of the sea
First of all do ye draw the ship up on the land and store your goods and all the tackling in caves
Then come back thyself and bring thy trusty comrades
So she spoke and my proud heart consented
I went my way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea and there I found my trusty comrades by the swift ship wailing piteously shedding big tears
And as when calves in a farmstead sport about the droves of cows returning to the yard when they have had their fill of grazingall together they frisk before them
and the pens no longer hold them but with constant lowing they run about their mothers
so those men when their eyes beheld me thronged about me weeping
and it seemed to their hearts as though they had got to their native land and the very city of rugged Ithaca  where they were bred and born
And with wailing they spoke to me winged words
At thy return O thou fostered of Zeus we are as glad as though we had returned to Ithaca  our native land
But come tell the fate of the others our comrades
So they spoke and I answered them with gentle words
First of all let us draw the ship up on the land and store our goods and all the tackling in caves
Then haste you one and all to go with me that you may see your comrades in the sacred halls of Circe drinking and eating
for they have unfailing store
So I spoke and they quickly hearkened to my words
Eurylochus alone sought to hold back all my comrades
and he spoke and addressed them with winged words
Ah wretched men whither are we going
Why are you so enamoured of these woes
as to go down to the house of Circe who will change us all to swine or wolves or lions that so we may guard her great house perforce Even so did the Cyclops when our comrades went to his fold and with them went this reckless Odysseus
For it was through this mans folly that they too perished
So he spoke and I pondered in heart whether to draw my long sword from beside my stout thigh and therewith strike off his head and bring it to the ground near kinsman of mine by marriage though he was
but my comrades one after another sought to check me with gentle words
O thou sprung from Zeus as for this man we will leave him if thou so biddest to abide here by the ship and to guard the ship
but as for us do thou lead us to the sacred house of Circe
So saying they went up from the ship and the sea
Nor was Eurylochus left beside the hollow ship but he went with us
for he feared my dread reproof
Meanwhile in her halls Circe bathed the rest of my comrades with kindly care and anointed them richly with oil and cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics
and we found them all feasting bountifully in the halls
But when they saw and recognized one another face to face they wept and wailed and the house rang around
Then the beautiful goddess drew near me and said
No longer now do ye rouse this plenteous lamenting
Of myself I know both all the woes you have suffered on the teeming deep and all the wrong that cruel men have done you on the land
Nay come eat food and drink wine until you once more get spirit in your breasts such as when at the first you left your native land of rugged Ithaca 
but now ye are withered and spiritless ever thinking of your weary wanderings nor are your hearts ever joyful for verily ye have suffered much
So she spoke and our proud hearts consented
So there day after day for a full year we abode feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine
But when a year was gone and the seasons turned as the months waned and the long days were brought in their course then my trusty comrades called me forth and said
Strange man bethink thee now at last of thy native land if it is fated for thee to be saved and to reach thy highroofed house and thy native land
So they spoke and my proud heart consented
So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine
But when the sun set and darkness came on they lay down to sleep throughout the shadowy halls
but I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe and besought her by her knees and the goddess heard my voice
and I spoke and addressed her with winged words
Circe fulfil for me the promise which thou gavest to send me home
for my spirit is now eager to be gone and the spirit of my comrades who make my heart to pine as they sit about me mourning whensoever thou haply art not at hand
So I spoke and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices abide ye now no longer in my house against your will
but you must first complete another journey and come to the house of Hades and dread Persephone to seek soothsaying of the spirit of Theban Teiresias the blind seer whose mind abides steadfast
To him even in death Persephone has granted reason that he alone should have understanding but the others flit about as shadows
So she spoke and my spirit was broken within me
and I wept as I sat on the bed nor had my heart any longer desire to live and behold the light of the sun
But when I had my fill of weeping and writhing then I made answer and addressed her saying
O Circe who will guide us on this journey
To Hades no man ever yet went in a black ship
So I spoke and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices let there be in thy mind no concern for a pilot to guide thy ship 1 but set up thy mast and spread the white sail and sit thee down
But and the breath of the North Wind will bear her onward
But when in thy ship thou hast now crossed the stream of Oceanus where is a level shore and the groves of Persephone tall poplars and willows that shed their fruitthere do thou beach thy ship by the deep eddying Oceanus but go thyself to the dank house of Hades
There into Acheron flow Periphlegethon and Cocytus which is a branch of the water of the Styx and there is a rock and the meeting place of the two roaring rivers
Thither prince do thou draw nigh as I bid thee and dig a pit of a cubits length this way and that and around it pour a libation to all the dead first with milk and honey thereafter with sweet wine and in the third place with water
and sprinkle thereon white barley meal
And do thou earnestly entreat the powerless heads of the dead vowing that when thou comest to Ithaca thou wilt sacrifice in thy halls a barren heifer the best thou hast and wilt fill the altar with rich gifts and that to Teiresias alone thou wilt sacrifice separately a ram wholly black the goodliest of thy flock
But when with prayers thou hast made supplication to the glorious tribes of the dead then sacrifice a ram and a black ewe turning their heads toward Erebus but thyself turning backward and setting thy face towards the streams of the river
Then many ghosts of men that are dead will come forth
But do thou thereafter call to thy comrades and bid them flay and burn the sheep that lie there slain by the pitiless bronze and make prayer to the gods to mighty Hades and to dread Persephone
And do thou thyself draw thy sharp sword from beside thy thigh and sit there not suffering the powerless heads of the dead to draw near to the blood till thou hast enquired of Teiresias
Then the seer will presently come to thee leader of men and he will tell thee thy way and the measures of thy path and of thy return how thou mayest go over the teeming deep
So she spoke and straightway came goldenthroned Dawn
Round about me then she cast a cloak and tunic as raiment
and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe finelywoven and beautiful and about her waist she cast a fair girdle of gold and upon her head she put a veil
But I went through the halls and roused my men with gentle words coming up to each man in turn
No longer now sleep ye and drowse in sweet slumber but let us go
lo queenly Circe has told me all
So I spoke and their proud hearts consented
But not even from thence could I lead my men unscathed
There was one Elpenor the youngest of all not over valiant in war nor sound of understanding
who had laid him down apart from his comrades in the sacred house of Circe seeking the cool air for he was heavy with wine
He heard the noise and the bustle of his comrades as they moved about and suddenly sprang up and forgot to go to the long ladder that he might come down again but fell headlong from the roof
and his neck was broken away from the spine and his spirit went down to the house of Hades
But as my men were going on their way I spoke among them saying
Ye think forsooth that ye are going to your dear native land
but Circe has pointed out for us another journey even to the house of Hades and dread Persephone to consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias
So I spoke and their spirit was broken within them and sitting down right where they were they wept and tore their hair
But no good came of their lamenting
But when we were on our way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea sorrowing and shedding big tears meanwhile Circe had gone forth and made fast beside the black ship a ram and a black ewe for easily had she passed us by
Who with his eyes could behold a god against his will whether going to or fro
But when we had come down to the ship and to the sea first of all we drew the ship down to the bright sea and set the mast and sail in the black ship and took the sheep and put them aboard and ourselves embarked sorrowing and shedding big tears
And for our aid in the wake of our darkprowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail a goodly comrade was sent by fairtressed Circe dread goddess of human speech
So when we had made fast all the tackling throughout the ship we sat down
and the wind and the helms man made straight her course
All the day long her sail was stretched as she sped over the sea
and the sun set and all the ways grew dark
She came to deepflowing Oceanus that bounds the Earth 1
where is the land and city of the Cimmerians wrapped in mist and cloud
Never does the bright sun look down on them with his rays either when he mounts the starry heaven or when he turns again to earth from heaven but baneful night is spread over wretched mortals
Thither we came and beached our ship and took out the sheep
and ourselves went beside the stream of Oceanus until we came to the place of which Circe had told us
Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims
while I drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh and dug a pit of a cubits length this way and that and around it poured a libation to all the dead first with milk and honey thereafter with sweet wine and in the third place with water
and I sprinkled thereon white barley meal
And I earnestly entreated the powerless heads of the dead vowing that when I came to Ithaca I would sacrifice in my halls a barren heifer the best I had and pile the altar with goodly gifts and to Teiresias alone would sacrifice separately a ram wholly black the goodliest of my flocks
But when with vows and prayers I had made supplication to the tribes of the dead I took the sheep and cut their throats over the pit and the dark blood ran forth
Then there gathered from out of Erebus the spirits of those that are dead
brides and unwedded youths and toilworn old men and tender maidens with hearts yet new to sorrow and many too that had been wounded with bronzetipped spears men slain in fight wearing their bloodstained armour
These came thronging in crowds about the pit from every side with a wondrous cry
and pale fear seized me
Then I called to my comrades and bade them flay and burn the sheep that lay there slain with the pitiless bronze and to make prayer to the gods to mighty Hades and dread Persephone
And I myself drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh and sat there and would not suffer the powerless heads of the dead to draw near to the blood until I had enquired of Teiresias
The first to come was the spirit of my comrade Elpenor
Not yet had he been buried beneath the broadwayed earth
for we had left his corpse behind us in the hall of Circe unwept and unburied since another task was then urging us on
When I saw him I wept and my heart had compassion on him and I spoke and addressed him with winged words
Elpenor how didst thou come beneath the murky darkness
Thou coming on foot hast outstripped me in my black ship
So I spoke and with a groan he answered me and said
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices an evil doom of some god was my undoing and measureless wine
When I had lain down to sleep in the house of Circe I did not think to go to the long ladder that I might come down again but fell headlong from the roof
and my neck was broken away from the spine and my spirit went down to the house of Hades
Now I beseech thee by those whom we left behind who are not present with us by thy wife and thy father who reared thee when a babe and by Telemachus whom thou didst leave an only son in thy halls
for I know that as thou goest hence from the house of Hades thou wilt touch at the Aeaean isle with thy wellbuilt ship
There then O prince I bid thee remember me
Leave me not behind thee unwept and unburied as thou goest thence and turn not away from me lest haply I bring the wrath of the gods upon thee Nay burn me with my armour all that is mine and heap up a mound for me on the shore of the grey sea in memory of an unhappy man that men yet to be may learn of me
Fulfil this my prayer and fix upon the mound my oar wherewith I rowed in life when I was among my comrades
So he spoke and I made answer and said
All this unhappy man will I perform and do
Thus we two sat and held sad converse one with the other I on one side holding my sword over the blood while on the other side the phantom of my comrade spoke at large
Then there came up the spirit of my dead mother Anticleia the daughter of greathearted Autolycus whom I had left alive when I departed for sacred Ilios 
At sight of her I wept and my heart had compassion on her
but even so I would not suffer her to come near the blood for all my great sorrow until I had enquired of Teiresias
Then there came up the spirit of the Theban Teiresias bearing his golden staff in his hand and he knew me and spoke to me
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices what now hapless man Why hast thou left the light of the sun and come hither to behold the dead and a region where is no joy
Nay give place from the pit and draw back thy sharp sword that I may drink of the blood and tell thee sooth
So he spoke and I gave place and thrust my silverstudded sword into its sheath
and when he had drunk the dark blood then the blameless seer spoke to me and said
Thou askest of thy honeysweet return glorious Odysseus
but this shall a god make grievous unto thee
for I think not that thou shalt elude the Earthshaker seeing that he has laid up wrath in his heart against thee angered that thou didst blind his dear son
Yet even so ye may reach home though in evil plight if thou wilt curb thine own spirit and that of thy comrades as soon as thou shalt bring thy wellbuilt ship to the island Thrinacia escaping from the violet sea and ye find grazing there the kine and goodly flocks of Helios who over sees and overhears all things
If thou leavest these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way verily ye may yet reach Ithaca  though in evil plight
But if thou harmest them then I foresee ruin for thy ship and thy comrades
and even if thou shalt thyself escape late shalt thou come home and in evil case after losing all thy comrades in a ship that is anothers
and thou shalt find woes in thy houseproud men that devour thy livelihood wooing thy godlike wife and offering wooers gifts
Yet verily on their violent deeds shalt thou take vengeance when thou comest
But when thou hast slain the wooers in thy halls whether by guile or openly with the sharp sword then do thou go forth taking a shapely oar until thou comest to men that know naught of the sea and eat not of food mingled with salt
aye and they know naught of ships with purple cheeks or of shapely oars that are as wings unto ships
And I will tell thee a sign right manifest which will not escape thee
When another wayfarer on meeting thee shall say that thou hast a winnowingfan on thy stout shoulder then do thou fix in the earth thy shapely oar and make goodly offerings to lord Poseidona ram and a bull and a boar that mates with sowsand depart for thy home and offer sacred hecatombs to the immortal gods who hold broad heaven to each one in due order
And death shall come to thee thyself far from the sea 1 a death so gentle that shall lay thee low when thou art overcome with sleek 1 old age
and thy people shall dwell in prosperity around thee
In this have I told thee sooth
So he spoke and I made answer and said
Teiresias of all this I ween the gods themselves have spun the thread
But come tell me this and declare it truly
I see here the spirit of my dead mother
she sits in silence near the blood and deigns not to look upon the face of her own son or to speak to him
Tell me prince how she may recognize that I am he
So I spoke and he straightway made answer and said
Easy is the word that I shall say and put in thy mind
Whomsoever of those that are dead and gone thou shalt suffer to draw near the blood he will tell thee sooth
but whomsoever thou refusest he surely will go back again
So saying the spirit of the prince Teiresias went back into the house of Hades when he had declared his prophecies
but I remained there steadfastly until my mother came up and drank the dark blood
At once then she knew me and with wailing she spoke to me winged words
My child how didst thou come beneath the murky darkness being still alive
Hard is it for those that live to behold these realms
for between are great rivers and dread streams Oceanus first which one may in no wise cross on foot but only if one have a wellbuilt ship
Art thou but now come hither from Troy after long wanderings with thy ship and thy companions
and hast thou not yet reached Ithaca  nor seen thy wife in thy halls
So she spoke and I made answer and said
My mother necessity brought me down to the house of Hades to seek soothsaying of the spirit of Theban Teiresias
For not yet have I come near to the shore of Achaea  nor have I as yet set foot on my own land but have ever been wandering laden with woe from the day when first I went with goodly Agamemnon to Ilios  famed for its horses to fight with the Trojans
But come tell me this and declare it truly
What fate of grievous death overcame thee
Was it long disease or did the archer Artemis assail thee with her gentle shafts and slay thee
And tell me of my father and my son whom I left behind me Does the honor that was mine still abide with them or does some other man now possess it and do they say that I shall no more return
And tell me of my wedded wife of her purpose and of her mind Does she abide with her son and keep all things safe or has one already wedded her whosoever is best of the Achaeans
So I spoke and my honored mother straightway answered
Aye verily she abides with steadfast heart in thy halls
and ever sorrowfully for her do the nights and the days wane as she weeps
But the fair honor that was thine no man yet possesses but Telemachus holds thy demesne unharassed and feasts a equal banquets such as it is fitting that one who deals judgment should share
for all men invite him
But thy father abides there in the tilled land and comes not to the city nor has he
for bedding bed and cloaks and bright coverlets but through the winter he sleeps in the house where the slaves sleep in the ashes by the fire and wears upon his body mean raiment
But when summer comes and rich autumn then all about the slope of his vineyard plot are strewn his lowly beds of fallen leaves
There he lies sorrowing and nurses his great grief in his heart in longing for thy return and heavy old age has come upon him
Even so did I too perish and meet my fate
Neither did the keensighted archer goddess assail me in my halls with her gentle shafts and slay me nor did any disease come upon me such as oftenest through grievous wasting takes the spirit from the limbs
nay it was longing for thee and for thy counsels glorious Odysseus and for thy tenderheartedness that robbed me of honeysweet life
So she spoke and I pondered in heart and was fain to clasp the spirit of my dead mother
Thrice I sprang towards her and my heart bade me clasp her and thrice she flitted from my arms like a shadow or a dream and pain grew ever sharper at my heart
And I spoke and addressed her with winged words
My mother why dost thou not stay for me who am eager to clasp thee that even in the house of Hades we two may cast our arms each about the other and take our fill of chill lamenting
Is this but a phantom that august Persephone has sent me that I may lament and groan the more
So I spoke and my honored mother straightway answered
Ah me my child illfated above all men in no wise does Persephone the daughter of Zeus deceive thee but this is the appointed way with mortals when one dies
For the sinews no longer hold the flesh and the bones together but the strong might of blazing fire destroys these as soon as the life leaves the white bones and the spirit like a dream flits away and hovers to and fro
But haste thee to the light with what speed thou mayest
and bear all these things in mind that thou mayest hereafter tell them to thy wife
Thus we two talked with one another and the women came for august Persephone sent them forth even all those that had been the wives and the daughters of chieftains
These flocked in throngs about the dark blood and I considered how I might question each
and this seemed to my mind the best counsel
I drew my long sword from beside my stout thigh and would not suffer them to drink of the dark blood all at one time
So they drew near one after the other and each declared her birth
and I questioned them all
Then verily the first that I saw was highborn Tyro who said that she was the daughter of noble Salmoneus and declared herself to be the wife of Cretheus son of Aeolus
She became enamoured of the river divine Enipeus who is far the fairest of rivers that send forth their streams upon the earth and she was wont to resort to the fair waters of Enipeus
But the Enfolder and Shaker of the earth took his form and lay with her at the mouths of the eddying river
And the dark wave stood about them like a mountain vaultedover and hid the god and the mortal woman
And he loosed her maiden girdle and shed sleep upon her
But when the god had ended his work of love he clasped her hand and spoke and addressed her
Be glad woman in our love
and as the year goes on its course thou shalt bear glorious children for not weak are the embraces of a god
These do thou tend and rear
But now go to thy house and hold thy peace and tell no man
but know that I am Poseidon the shaker of the earth
So saying he plunged beneath the surging sea
But she conceived and bore Pelias and Neleus who both became strong servants of great Zeus
and Pelias dwelt in spacious Iolcus and was rich in flocks and the other dwelt in sandy Pylos 
But her other children she the queenly among women bore to Cretheus even Aeson and Pheres and Amythaon who fought from chariots 1
And after her I saw Antiope daughter of Asopus who boasted that she had slept even in the arms of Zeus and she bore two sons Amphion and Zethus who first established the seat of sevengated Thebe and fenced it in with walls for they could not dwell in spacious Thebe unfenced how mighty soever they were
And after her I saw Alcmene wife of Amphitryon who lay in the arms of great Zeus and bore Heracles staunch in fight the lionhearted
And Megara I saw daughter of Creon highofheart whom the son of Amphitryon ever stubborn in might had to wife
And I saw the mother of Oedipodes fair Epicaste who wrought a monstrous deed in ignorance of mind in that she wedded her own son
and he when he had slain his own father wedded her
and straightway the gods made these things known among men
Howbeit he abode as lord of the Cadmeans in lovely Thebe suffering woes through the baneful counsels of the gods
but she went down to the house of Hades the strong warder
She made fast a noose on high from a lofty beam overpowered by her sorrow but for him she left behind woes full many even all that the Avengers of a mother bring to pass
And I saw beauteous Chloris whom once Neleus wedded because of her beauty when he had brought countless gifts of wooing Youngest daughter was she of Amphion son of Iasus who once ruled mightily in Orchomenus of the Minyae
And she was queen of Pylos  and bore to her husband glorious children Nestor and Chromius and lordly Periclymenus and besides these she bore noble Pero  a wonder to men
Her all that dwelt about sought in marriage
but Neleus would give her to no man save to him who should drive from Phylace the kine of mighty Iphicles sleek and broad of brow and hard they were to drive
These the blameless seer alone undertook to drive off
but a grievous fate of the gods ensnared him even hard bonds and the herdsmen of the field
Howbeit when at length the months and the days were being brought to fulfillment as the year rolled round and the seasons came on then verily mighty Iphicles released him when he had told all the oracles
and the will of Zeus was fulfilled
And I saw Lede  the wife of Tyndareus who bore to Tyndareus two sons stout of heart Castor the tamer of horses and the boxer Polydeuces These two the earth the giver of life covers albeit alive
and even in the world below they have honor from Zeus day they live in turn and one day they are dead
and they have won honor like unto that of the gods
And after her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who declared that she had lain with Poseidon She bore two sons but short of life were they godlike Otus and farfamed Ephialtesmen whom the earth the giver of grain reared as the tallest and far the comeliest after the famous Orion
For at nine years they were nine cubits in breadth and in height nine fathoms
Yea and they threatened to raise the din of furious war against the immortals in Olympus 
They were fain to pile Ossa on Olympus  and Pelion with its waving forests on Ossa that so heaven might be scaled
And this they would have accomplished if they had reached the measure of manhood
but the son of Zeus whom fairhaired Leto bore slew them both before the down blossomed beneath their temples and covered their chins with a full growth of beard
And Phaedra and Procris I saw and fair Ariadne the daughter of Minos of baneful mind whom once Theseus was fain to bear from Crete to the hill of sacred Athens  but he had no joy of her
for ere that Artemis slew her in seagirt Dia because of the witness of Dionysus
And Maera and Clymene I saw and hateful Eriphyle who took precious gold as the price of the life of her own lord
But I cannot tell or name all the wives and daughters of heroes that I saw
ere that immortal night would wane
Nay it is now time to sleep either when I have gone to the swift ship and the crew or here
My sending shall rest with the gods and with you
So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence and were held spellbound throughout the shadowy halls
Then among them whitearmed Arete was the first to speak
Phaeacians how seems this man to you for comeliness and stature and for the balanced spirit within him
And moreover he is my guest though each of you has a share in this honor
Wherefore be not in haste to send him away nor stint your gifts to one in such need
for many are the treasures which lie stored in your halls by the favour of the gods
Then among them spoke also the old lord Echeneus who was an elder among the Phaeacians
Friends verily not wide of the mark or of our own thought are the words of our wise queen
Nay do you give heed to them
Yet it is on Alcinous here that deed and word depend
Then again Alcinous answered him and said
This word of hers shall verily hold as surely as I live and am lord over the Phaeacians lovers of the oar
But let our guest for all his great longing to return nevertheless endure to remain until tomorrow till I shall make all our gift complete
His sending shall rest with the men with all but most of all with me
for mine is the control in the land
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said
Lord Alcinous renowned above all men if you should bid me abide here even for a year and should further my sending and give glorious gifts even that would I choose and it would be better far to come with a fuller hand to my dear native land
Aye and I should win more respect and love from all men who should see me when I had returned to Ithaca 
Then again Alcinous made answer and said
Odysseus in no wise as we look on thee do we deem this of thee that thou art a cheat and a dissembler such as are many whom the dark earth breeds scattered far and wide men that fashion lies out of what no man can even see
But upon thee is grace of words and within thee is a heart of wisdom
and thy tale thou hast told with skill as doth a minstrel even the grievous woes of all the Argives and of thine own self
But come tell me this and declare it truly whether thou sawest any of thy godlike comrades who went to Ilios together with thee and there met their fate
The night is before us long aye wondrous long and it is not yet the time for sleep in the hall
Tell on I pray thee the tale of these wondrous deeds
Verily I could abide until bright dawn so thou wouldest be willing to tell in the hall of these woes of thine
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said
Lord Alcinous renowned above all men there is a time for many words and there is a time also for sleep
But if thou art fain still to listen I would not begrudge to tell thee of other things more pitiful still than these even the woes of my comrades who perished afterward who escaped from the dread battlecry of the Trojans but perished on their return through the will of an evil woman
When then holy Persephone had scattered this way and that the spirits of the women there came up the spirit of Agamemnon son of Atreus sorrowing
and round about him others were gathered spirits of all those who were slain with him in the house of Aegisthus and met their fate
He knew me straightway when he had drunk the dark blood
and he wept aloud and shed big tears and stretched forth his hands toward me eager to reach me
But no longer had he aught of strength or might remaining such as of old was in his supple limbs
When I saw him I wept and my heart had compassion on him and I spoke and addressed him with winged words
Most glorious son of Atreus king of men Agamemnon what fate of grievous death overcame thee
Did Poseidon smite thee on board thy ships when he had roused a furious blast of cruel winds
Or did foemen work thee harm on the land while thou wast cutting off their cattle and fair flocks of sheep or wast fighting to win their city and their women
So I spoke and he straightway made answer and said
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices neither did Poseidon smite me on board my ships when he had roused a furious blast of cruel winds nor did foemen work me harm on the land but Aegisthus wrought for me death and fate and slew me with the aid of my accursed wife when he had bidden me to his house and made me a feast even as one slays an ox at the stall
So I died by a most pitiful death
and round about me the rest of my comrades were slain unceasingly like whitetusked swine which are slaughtered in the house of a rich man of great might at a marriage feast or a joint meal or a rich drinkingbout
Ere now thou hast been present at the slaying of many men killed in single combat or in the press of the fight
but in heart thou wouldst have felt most pity hadst thou seen that sight how about the mixing bowl and the laden tables we lay in the hall and the floor all swam with blood
But the most piteous cry that I heard was that of the daughter of Priam Cassandra whom guileful Clytemnestra slew by my side 1 And I sought to raise my hands and smite down the murderess dying though I was pierced through with the sword
But she the shameless one turned her back upon me and even though I was going to the house of Hades deigned neither to draw down my eyelids with her fingers nor to close my mouth
So true is it that there is nothing more dread or more shameless than a woman who puts into her heart such deeds
even as she too devised a monstrous thing contriving death for her wedded husband
Verily I thought that I should come home welcome to my children and to my slaves
but she with her heart set on utter wickedness has shed shame on herself and on women yet to be even upon her that doeth uprightly
So he spoke and I made answer and said
Ah verily has Zeus whose voice is borne afar visited wondrous hatred on the race of Atreus from the first because of the counsels of women
For Helens sake many of us perished and against thee Clytemnestra spread a snare whilst thou wast afar
So I spoke and he straightway made answer and said
Wherefore in thine own case be thou never gentle even to thy wife
Declare not to her all the thoughts of thy heart but tell her somewhat and let somewhat also be hidden
Yet not upon thee Odysseus shall death come from thy wife
for very prudent and of an understanding heart is the daughter of Icarius wise Penelope
Verily we left her a bride newly wed when we went to the war
and a boy was at her breast a babe who now I ween sits in the ranks of men happy in that his dear father will behold him when he comes
and he will greet his father as is meet
But my wife did not let me sate my eyes even with sight of my own son
Nay ere that she slew even me her husband
And another thing will I tell thee and do thou lay it to heart
in secret and not openly do thou bring thy ship to the shore of thy dear native land
for no longer is there faith in women
But come tell me this and declare it truly whether haply ye hear of my son as yet alive in Orchomenus it may be or in sandy Pylos  or yet with Menelaus in wide Sparta 
for not yet has goodly Orestes perished on the earth
So he spoke and I made answer and said
Son of Atreus wherefore dost thou question me of this
I know not at all whether he be alive or dead
and it is an ill thing to speak words vain as wind
Thus we two stood and held sad converse with one another sorrowing and shedding big tears
and there came up the spirit of Achilles son of Peleus and those of Patroclus and of peerless Antilochus and of Aias who in comeliness and form was the goodliest of all the Danaans after the peerless son of Peleus
And the spirit of the swiftfooted son of Aeacus recognized me and weeping spoke to me winged words
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices rash man what deed yet greater than this wilt thou devise in thy heart
How didst thou dare to come down to Hades where dwell the unheeding dead the phantoms of men outworn 1
So he spoke and I made answer and said
Achilles son of Peleus far the mightiest of the Achaeans I came through need of Teiresias 1 if haply he would tell me some plan whereby I might reach rugged Ithaca 
For not yet have I come near to the land of Achaea  nor have I as yet set foot on my own country but am ever suffering woes
whereas than thou Achilles no man aforetime was more blessed nor shall ever be hereafter
For of old when thou wast alive we Argives honored thee even as the gods and now that thou art here thou rulest mightily among the dead
Wherefore grieve not at all that thou art dead Achilles
So I spoke and he straightway made answer and said
Nay seek not to speak soothingly to me of death glorious Odysseus
I should choose so I might live on earth 2 to serve as the hireling of another of some portionless man whose livelihood was but small rather than to be lord over all the dead that have perished
But come tell me tidings of my son that lordly youth whether or not he followed to the war to be a leader
And tell me of noble Peleus if thou hast heard aught whether he still has honor among the host of the Myrmidons or whether men do him dishonor throughout Hellas and Phthia  because old age binds him hand and foot
For I am not there to bear him aid beneath the rays of the sun in such strength as once was mine in wide Troy  when I slew the best of the host in defence of the Argives
If but in such strength I could come were it but for an hour to my fathers house
I would give many a one of those who do him violence and keep him from his honor cause to rue my strength and my invincible hands
So he spoke and I made answer and said
Verily of noble Peleus have I heard naught but as touching thy dear son Neoptolemus I will tell thee all the truth as thou biddest me
I it was myself who brought him from Scyros in my shapely hollow ship to join the host of the wellgreaved Archaeans
And verily as often as we took counsel around the city of Troy  he was ever the first to speak and made no miss of words
godlike Nestor and I alone surpassed him
But as often as we fought with the bronze on the Trojan plain he would never remain behind in the throng or press of men but would ever run forth far to the front yielding to none in his might and many men he slew in dread combat
All of them I could not tell or name all the host that he slew in defence of the Argives but what a warrior was that son of Telephus whom he slew with the sword the prince Eurypylus Aye and many of his comrades the Ceteians were slain about him because of gifts a woman craved 1
He verily was the comeliest man I saw next to goodly Memnon
And again when we the best of the Argives were about to go down into the horse which Epeus made and the command of all was laid upon me both to open and to close the door of our stoutbuilt ambush then the other leaders and counsellors of the Danaans would wipe away tears from their eyes and each mans limbs shook beneath him
but never did my eyes see his fair face grow pale at all nor see him wiping tears from his cheeks
but he earnestly besought me to let him go forth from the horse and kept handling his swordhilt and his spear heavy with bronze and was eager to work harm to the Trojans
But after we had sacked the lofty city of Priam he went on board his ship with his share of the spoil and a goodly prize all unscathed he was neither smitten with the sharp spear nor wounded in close fight as often befalls in war
for Ares rages confusedly
So I spoke and the spirit of the son of Aeacus departed with long strides over the field of asphodel joyful in that I said that his son was preeminent
And other spirits of those dead and gone stood sorrowing and each asked of those dear to him
Alone of them all the spirit of Aias son of Telamon stood apart still full of wrath for the victory that I had won over him in the contest by the ships for the arms of Achilles
whose honored mother had set them for a prize
and the judges were the sons of the Trojans and Pallas Athena
I would that I had never won in the contest for such a prize
over so noble a head did the earth close because of those arms even over Aias who in comeliness and in deeds of war was above all the other Achaeans next to the peerless son of Peleus
To him I spoke with soothing words
Aias son of peerless Telamon wast thou then not even in death to forget thy wrath against me because of those accursed arms
Surely the gods set them to be a bane to the Argives such a tower of strength was lost to them in thee
and for thee in death we Achaeans sorrow unceasingly even as for the life of Achilles son of Peleus
Yet no other is to blame but Zeus who bore terrible hatred against the host of Danaan spearmen and brought on thee thy doom
Nay come hither prince that thou mayest hear my word and my speech
and subdue thy wrath and thy proud spirit
So I spoke but he answered me not a word but went his way to Erebus to join the other spirits of those dead and gone
Then would he nevertheless have spoken to me for all his wrath or I to him
but the heart in my breast was fain to see the spirits of those others that are dead
There then I saw Minos the glorious son of Zeus golden sceptre in hand giving judgment to the dead from his seat while they sat and stood about the king through the widegated house of Hades and asked of him judgment
And after him I marked huge Orion driving together over the field of asphodel wild beasts which he himself had slain on the lonely hills and in his hands he held a club all of bronze ever unbroken
And I saw Tityos son of glorious Gaea lying on the ground
Over nine roods 1 he stretched and two vultures sat one on either side and tore his liver plunging their beaks into his bowels nor could he beat them off with his hands
For he had offered violence to Leto the glorious wife of Zeus as she went toward Pytho through Panopeus with its lovely lawns
Aye and I saw Tantalus in violent torment standing in a pool
and the water came nigh unto his chin
He seemed as one athirst but could not take and drink
for as often as that old man stooped down eager to drink so often would the water be swallowed up and vanish away and at his feet the black earth would appear for some god made all dry
And trees high and leafy let stream their fruits above his head pears and pomegranates and apple trees with their bright fruit and sweet figs and luxuriant olives
But as often as that old man would reach out toward these to clutch them with his hands the wind would toss them to the shadowy clouds
Aye and I saw Sisyphus in violent torment seeking to raise a monstrous stone with both his hands
Verily he would brace himself with hands and feet and thrust the stone toward the crest of a hill
but as often as he was about to heave it over the top the weight would turn it back
and then down again to the plain would come rolling the ruthless stone
But he would strain again and thrust it back and the sweat flowed down from his limbs and dust rose up from his head
And after him I marked the mighty Heracleshis phantom
for he himself among the immortal gods takes his joy in the feast and has to wife Hebe of the fair ankles daughter of great Zeus and of Here of the golden sandals
About him rose a clamor from the dead as of birds flying everywhere in terror
and he like dark night with his bow bare and with arrow on the string glared about him terribly like one in act to shoot
Awful was the belt about his breast a baldric of gold whereon wondrous things were fashioned bears and wild boars and lions with flashing eyes and conflicts and battles and murders and slayings of men
May he never have designed 1 or hereafter design such another even he who stored up in his craft the device of that belt
He in turn knew me when his eyes beheld me and weeping spoke to me winged words
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices ah wretched man dost thou too drag out an evil lot such as I once bore beneath the rays of the sun
I was the son of Zeus son of Cronos but I had woe beyond measure
for to a man far worse than I was I made subject and he laid on me hard labours
Yea he once sent me hither to fetch the hound of Hades
for he could devise for me no other task mightier than this
The hound I carried off and led forth from the house of Hades
and Hermes was my guide and flashingeyed Athena
So saying he went his way again into the house of Hades but I abode there steadfastly in the hope that some other haply might still come forth of the warrior heroes who died in the days of old
And I should have seen yet others of the men of former time whom I was fain to behold even Theseus and Peirithous glorious children of the gods
but ere that the myriad tribes of the dead came thronging up with a wondrous cry
and pale fear seized me lest august Persephone might send forth upon me from out the house of Hades the head of the Gorgon that awful monster
Straightway then I went to the ship and bade my comrades themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables
So they went on board quickly and sat down upon the benches
And the ship was borne down the stream Oceanus by the swelling flood first with our rowing and afterwards the wind was fair
Now after our ship had left the stream of the river Oceanus and had come to the wave of the broad sea and the Aeaean isle where is the dwelling of early Dawn and her dancinglawns and the risings of the sun there on our coming we beached our ship on the sands and ourselves went forth upon the shore of the sea
and there we fell asleep and waited for the bright Dawn
As soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered then I sent forth my comrades to the house of Circe to fetch the body of the dead Elpenor
Straightway then we cut billets of wood and gave him burial where the headland runs furthest out to sea sorrowing and shedding big tears
But when the dead man was burned and the armour of the dead we heaped up a mound and dragged on to it a pillar and on the top of the mound we planted his shapely oar
We then were busied with these several tasks
howbeit Circe was not unaware of our coming forth from the house of Hades but speedily she arrayed herself and came
and her handmaids brought with her bread and meat in abundance and flaming red wine
And the beautiful goddess stood in our midst and spoke among us saying
Rash men who have gone down alive to the house of Hades to meet death twice while other men die but once
Nay come eat food and drink wine here this whole day through
but at the coming of Dawn ye shall set sail
and I will point out the way and declare to you each thing in order that ye may not suffer pain and woes through wretched illcontriving either by sea or on land
So she spoke and our proud hearts consented
So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine
But when the sun set and darkness came on they lay down to rest beside the stern cables of the ship but Circe took me by the hand and leading me apart from my dear comrades made me to sit and herself lay down close at hand and asked me all the tale
And I told her all in due order
Then queenly Circe spoke to me and said
All these things have thus found an end but do thou hearken as I shall tell thee and a god shall himself bring it to thy mind
To the Sirens first shalt thou come who beguile all men whosoever comes to them
Whoso in ignorance draws near to them and hears the Sirens voice he nevermore returns that his wife and little children may stand at his side rejoicing but the Sirens beguile him with their cleartoned song as they sit in a meadow and about them is a great heap of bones of mouldering men and round the bones the skin is shrivelling
But do thou row past them and anoint the ears of thy comrades with sweet wax which thou hast kneaded lest any of the rest may hear
But if thou thyself hast a will to listen let them bind thee in the swift ship hand and foot upright in the step of the mast and let the ropes be made fast at the ends to the mast itself that with delight thou mayest listen to the voice of the two Sirens
And if thou shalt implore and bid thy comrades to loose thee then let them bind thee with yet more bonds
But when thy comrades shall have rowed past these thereafter I shall not fully say on which side thy course is to lie but do thou thyself ponder it in mind
and I will tell thee of both ways
For on the one hand are beetling crags and against them roars the great wave of darkeyed Amphitrite
the Planctae 1 do the blessed gods call these
Thereby not even winged things may pass no not the timorous doves that bear ambrosia to father Zeus but the smooth rock ever snatches away one even of these
and the father sends in another to make up the tale
And thereby has no ship of men ever yet escaped that has come thither but the planks of ships and bodies of men are whirled confusedly by the waves of the sea and the blasts of baneful fire
One seafaring ship alone has passed thereby that Argo famed of all on her voyage from Aeetes
and even her the wave would speedily have dashed there against the great crags had not Here sent her through for that Jason was dear to her
Now on the other path are two cliffs one of which reaches with its sharp peak to the broad heaven and a dark cloud surrounds it
This never melts away nor does clear sky ever surround that peak in summer or in harvest time
No mortal man could scale it or set foot upon the top not though he had twenty hands and feet
for the rock is smooth as if it were polished
And in the midst of the cliff is a dim cave turned to the West toward Erebus even where you shall steer your hollow ship glorious Odysseus
Not even a man of might could shoot an arrow from the hollow ship so as to reach into that vaulted cave
Therein dwells Scylla yelping terribly
Her voice is indeed but as the voice of a newborn whelp but she herself is an evil monster
nor would anyone be glad at sight of her no not though it were a god that met her
Verily she has twelve feet all misshapen 1 and six necks exceeding long and on each one an awful head and therein three rows of teeth thick and close and full of black death
Up to her middle she is hidden in the hollow cave but she holds her head out beyond the dread chasm and fishes there eagerly searching around the rock for dolphins and seadogs and whatever greater beast she may haply catch such creatures as deepmoaning Amphitrite rears in multitudes past counting
By her no sailors yet may boast that they have fled unscathed in their ship
for with each head she carries off a man snatching him from the darkprowed ship
But the other cliff thou wilt note Odysseus is lower
they are close to each other
thou couldst even shoot an arrow across
and on it is a great fig tree with rich foliage
but beneath this divine Charybdis sucks down the black water
Thrice a day she belches it forth and thrice she sucks it down terribly
Mayest thou not be there when she sucks it down
for no one could save thee from ruin no not the Earthshaker
Nay draw very close to Scyllas cliff and drive thy ship past quickly for it is better far to mourn six comrades in thy ship than all together
So she spoke but I made answer and said
Come I pray thee goddess tell me this thing truly if in any wise I might escape from fell Charybids and ward off that other when she works harm to my comrades
So I spoke and the beautiful goddess answered and said
Rash man lo now again thy heart is set on the deeds of war and on toil
Wilt thou not yield even to the immortal gods
She is not mortal but an immortal bane dread and dire and fierce and not to be fought with
there is no defence
to flee from her is bravest
For if thou tarriest to arm thyself by the cliff I fear lest she may again dart forth and attack thee with as many heads and seize as many men as before
Nay row past with all thy might and call upon Crataiis the mother of Scylla who bore her for a bane to mortals
Then will she keep her from darting forth again
And thou wilt come to the isle Thrinacia
There in great numbers feed the kine of Helios and his goodly flocks seven herds of kine and as many fair flocks of sheep and fifty in each
These bear no young nor do they ever die
and goddesses are their shepherds fairtressed nymphs Phaethusa and Lampetie whom beautiful Neaera bore to Helios Hyperion
These their honored mother when she had borne and reared them sent to the isle Thrinacia to dwell afar and keep the flocks of their father and his sleek kine
If thou leavest these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way verily ye may yet reach Ithaca  though in evil plight
But if thou harmest them then I foretell ruin for thy ship and for thy comrades
and even if thou shalt thyself escape late shalt thou come home and in evil case after losing all thy comrades
So she spoke and presently came goldenthroned Dawn
Then the beautiful goddess departed up the island
but I went to the ship and roused my comrades themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables
So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches
and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars
And for our aid in the wake of our darkprowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail a goodly comrade was sent by fairtressed Circe dread goddess of human speech
So when we had straightway made fast all the tackling throughout the ship we sat down
but the wind and the helmsman guided the ship
Then verily I spoke among my comrades grieved at heart
Friends since it is not right that one or two alone should know the oracles that Circe the beautiful goddess told me
therefore will I tell them in order that knowing them we may either die or shunning death and fate escape
First she bade us avoid the voice of the wondrous Sirens and their flowery meadow
Me alone she bade to listen to their voice
but do ye bind me with grievous bonds that I may abide fast where I am upright in the step of the mast and let the ropes be made fast at the ends to the mast itself
and if I implore and bid you to loose me then do ye tie me fast with yet more bonds
Thus I rehearsed all these things and told them to my comrades
Meanwhile the wellbuilt ship speedily came to the isle of the two Sirens
for a fair and gentle wind bore her on
Then presently the wind ceased and there was a windless calm and a god lulled the waves to sleep
But my comrades rose up and furled the sail and stowed it in the hollow ship and thereafter sat at the oars and made the water white with their polished oars of fir
But I with my sharp sword cut into small bits a great round cake of wax and kneaded it with my strong hands
and soon the wax grew warm forced by the strong pressure and the rays of the lord Helios Hyperion 1
Then I anointed with this the ears of all my comrades in turn
and they bound me in the ship hand and foot upright in the step of the mast and made the ropes fast at the ends to the mast itself
and themselves sitting down smote the grey sea with their oars
But when we were as far distant as a man can make himself heard when he shouts driving swiftly on our way the Sirens failed not to note the swift ship as it drew near and they raised their cleartoned song
Come hither as thou farest renowned Odysseus great glory of the Achaeans stay thy ship that thou mayest listen to the voice of us two
For never yet has any man rowed past this isle in his black ship until he has heard the sweet voice from our lips Nay he has joy of it and goes his way a wiser man
For we know all the toils that in wide Troy the Argives and Trojans endured through the will of the gods and we know all things that come to pass upon the fruitful earth
So they spoke sending forth their beautiful voice
and my heart was fain to listen and I bade my comrades loose me nodding to them with my brows
but they fell to their oars and rowed on
And presently Perimedes and Eurylochus arose and bound me with yet more bonds and drew them tighter
But when they had rowed past the Sirens and we could no more hear their voice or their song then straightway my trusty comrades took away the wax with which I had anointed their ears and loosed me from my bonds
But when we had left the island I presently saw smoke and a great billow and heard a booming
Then from the hands of my men in their terror the oars flew and splashed one and all in the swirl
and the ship stood still where it was when they no longer plied with their hands the tapering oars
But I went through the ship and cheered my men with gentle words coming up to each man in turn
Friends hitherto we have been in no wise ignorant of sorrow
surely this evil that besets us now is no greater than when the Cyclops penned us in his hollow cave by brutal strength
yet even thence we made our escape through my valor and counsel and wit these dangers too methinks we shall some day remember
But now come as I bid let us all obey
Do you keep your seats on the benches and smite with your oars the deep surf of the sea in the hope that Zeus may grant us to escape and avoid this death
And to thee steersman I give this command
and do thou lay it to heart since thou wieldest the steering oar of the hollow ship
From this smoke and surf keep the ship well away and hug the cliff lest ere thou know it the ship swerve off to the other side and thou cast us into destruction
So I spoke and they quickly hearkened to my words
But of Scylla I went not on to speak a cureless bane lest haply my comrades seized with fear should cease from rowing and huddle together in the hold
Then verily I forgot the hard command of Circe whereas she bade me in no wise to arm myself
but when I had put on my glorious armour and grasped in my hand two long spears I went to the foredeck of the ship
whence I deemed that Scylla of the rock would first be seen who was to bring ruin upon my comrades
But nowhere could I descry her and my eyes grew weary as I gazed everywhere toward the misty rock
We then sailed on up the narrow strait with wailing
For on one side lay Scylla and on the other divine Charybdis terribly sucked down the salt water of the sea
Verily whenever she belched it forth like a cauldron on a great fire she would seethe and bubble in utter turmoil and high over head the spray would fall on the tops of both the cliffs
But as often as she sucked down the salt water of the sea within she could all be seen in utter turmoil and round about the rock roared terribly while beneath the earth appeared black with sand
and pale fear seized my men
So we looked toward her and feared destruction
but meanwhile Scylla seized from out the hollow ship six of my comrades who were the best in strength and in might
Turning my eyes to the swift ship and to the company of my men 1 even then I noted above me their feet and hands as they were raised aloft
To me they cried aloud calling upon me by name for that last time in anguish of heart
And as a fisher on a jutting rock when he casts in his baits as a snare to the little fishes with his long pole lets down into the sea the horn of an ox of the steading 2 and then as he catches a fish flings it writhing ashore even so were they drawn writhing up towards the cliffs
Then at her doors she devoured them shrieking and stretching out their hands toward me in their awful deathstruggle
Most piteous did mine eyes behold that thing of all that I bore while I explored the paths of the sea
Now when we had escaped the rocks and dread Charybdis and Scylla presently then we came to the goodly island of the god
where were the fair kine broad of brow and the many goodly flocks of Helios Hyperion
Then while I was still out at sea in my black ship I heard the lowing of the cattle that were being stalled and the bleating of the sheep
and upon my mind fell the words of the blind seer Theban Teiresias and of Aeaean Circe who very straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios who gives joy to mortals
Then verily I spoke among my comrades grieved at heart
Hear my words comrades for all your evil plight that I may tell you the oracles of Teiresias and of Aeaean Circe who very straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios who gives joy to mortals
for there she said was our most terrible bane
Nay row the black ship out past the island
So I spoke but their spirit was broken within them
and straightway Eurylochus answered me with hateful words
Hardy art thou Odysseus
thou hast strength beyond that of other men and thy limbs never grow weary
Verily thou art wholly wrought of iron seeing that thou sufferest not thy comrades worn out with toil and drowsiness to set foot on shore where on this seagirt isle we might once more make ready a savoury supper but thou biddest us even as we are to wander on through the swift night driven away from the island over the misty deep
It is from the night that fierce winds are born wreckers of ships
How could one escape utter destruction if haply there should suddenly come a blast of the South Wind or the blustering West Wind  which oftenest wreck ships in despite of the sovereign gods
Nay verily for this time let us yield to black night and make ready our supper remaining by the swift ship and in the morning we will go aboard and put out into the broad sea
So spoke Eurylochus and the rest of my comrades gave assent
Then verily I knew that some god was assuredly devising ill and I spoke and addressed him with winged words
Eurylochus verily ye constrain me who stand alone
But come now do ye all swear to me a mighty oath to the end that
if we haply find a herd of kine or a great flock of sheep no man may slay either cow or sheep in the blind folly of his mind
but be content to eat the food which immortal Circe gave
So I spoke and they straightway swore that they would not even as I bade them
But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath we moored our wellbuilt ship in the hollow harbor near a spring of sweet water and my comrades went forth from the ship and skilfully made ready their supper
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink then they fell to weeping as they remembered their dear comrades whom Scylla had snatched from out the hollow ship and devoured
and sweet sleep came upon them as they wept
But when it was the third watch of the night and the stars had turned their course Zeus the cloudgatherer roused against us a fierce wind with a wondrous tempest and hid with clouds the land and sea alike
and night rushed down from heaven
And as soon as early Dawn appeared the rosyfingered we dragged our ship and made her fast in a hollow cave
where were the fair dancingfloors and seats of the nymphs
Then I called my men together and spoke among them
Friends in our swift ship is meat and drink let us therefore keep our hands from those kine lest we come to harm
for these are the cows and goodly sheep of a dread god even of Helios who oversees all things and overhears all things
So I spoke and their proud hearts consented
Then for a full month the South Wind blew unceasingly nor did any other wind arise except the East and the South
Now so long as my men had grain and red wine they kept their hands from the kine for they were eager to save their lives 1
But when all the stores had been consumed from out the ship and now they must needs roam about in search of game fishes and fowl and whatever might come to their handsfishing with bent hooks for hunger pinched their bellies
then I went apart up the island that I might pray to the gods in the hope that one of them might show me a way to go
And when as I went through the island I had got away from my comrades I washed my hands in a place where there was shelter from the wind and prayed to all the gods that hold Olympus 
but they shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids
And meanwhile Eurylochus began to give evil counsel to my comrades
Hear my words comrades for all your evil plight
All forms of death are hateful to wretched mortals but to die of hunger and so meet ones doom is the most pitiful
Nay come let us drive off the best of the kine of Helios and offer sacrifice to the immortals who hold broad heaven
And if we ever reach Ithaca  our native land we will straightway build a rich temple to Helios Hyperion and put therein many goodly offerings
And if haply he be wroth at all because of his straighthorned kine and be minded to destroy our ship and the other gods consent rather would I lose my life once for all with a gulp at the wave than pine slowly away in a desert isle
So spoke Eurylochus and the rest of my comrades gave assent
Straightway they drove off the best of the kine of Helios from near at hand for not far from the darkprowed ship were grazing the fair sleek kine broad of brow
Around these then they stood and made prayer to the gods plucking the tender leaves from off a highcrested oak 1
for they had no white barley on board the wellbenched ship
Now when they had prayed and had cut the throats of the kine and flayed them they cut out the thighpieces and covered them with a double layer of fat and laid raw flesh upon them
They had no wine to pour over the blazing sacrifice but they made libations with water and roasted all the entrails over the fire
Now when the thighs were wholly burned and they had tasted the inner parts they cut up the rest and spitted it
Then it was that sweet sleep fled from my eyelids and I went my way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea
But when as I went I drew near to the curved ship then verily the hot savour of the fat was wafted about me
and I groaned and cried aloud to the immortal gods
Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are for ever verily it was for my ruin that ye lulled me in pitiless sleep
while my comrades remaining behind have contrived a monstrous deed
Swiftly then to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie of the long robes bearing tidings that we had slain his kine
and straightway he spoke among the immortals wroth at heart
Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are for ever take vengeance now on the comrades of Odysseus son of Laertes who have insolently slain my kine in which I ever took delight when I went toward the starry heaven and when I turned back again to earth from heaven
If they do not pay me fit atonement for the kine I will go down to Hades and shine among the dead
Then Zeus the cloudgatherer answered him and said
Helios do thou verily shine on among the immortals and among mortal men upon the earth the giver of grain
As for these men I will soon smite their swift ship with my bright thunderbolt and shatter it to pieces in the midst of the winedark sea
This I heard from fairhaired Calypso
and she said that she herself had heard it from the messenger Hermes
But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea I upbraided my men coming up to each in turn but we could find no remedythe kine were already dead
For my men then the gods straightway shewed forth portents
The hides crawled the flesh both roast and raw bellowed upon the spits and there was a lowing as of kine
For six days then my trusty comrades feasted on the best of the kine of Helios which they had driven off
But when Zeus the son of Cronos brought upon us the seventh day then the wind ceased to blow tempestuously and we straightway went on board and put out into the broad sea when we had set up the mast and hoisted the white sail
But when we had left that island and no other land appeared but only sky and sea then verily the son of Cronos set a black cloud above the hollow ship and the sea grew dark beneath it
She ran on for no long time
for straightway came the shrieking West Wind  blowing with a furious tempest and the blast of the wind snapped both the forestays of the mast
so that the mast fell backward and all its tackling was strewn in the bilge
On the stern of the ship the mast struck the head of the pilot and crushed all the bones of his skull together
and like a diver he fell from the deck and his proud spirit left his bones
Therewith Zeus thundered and hurled his bolt upon the ship
and she quivered from stem to stern smitten by the bolt of Zeus and was filled with sulphurous smoke and my comrades fell from out the ship
Like seacrows they were borne on the waves about the black ship and the god took from them their returning
But I kept pacing up and down the ship till the surge tore the sides from the keel and the wave bore her on dismantled and snapped the mast off at the keel
but over the mast had been flung the backstay fashioned of oxhide
with this I lashed the two together both keel and mast and sitting on these was borne by the direful winds
Then verily the West Wind ceased to blow tempestuously and swiftly the South Wind came bringing sorrow to my heart that I might traverse again the way to baneful Charybdis 
All night long was I borne and at the rising of the sun I came to the cliff of Scylla and to dread Charybdis 
She verily sucked down the salt water of the sea
but I springing up to the tall figtree laid hold of it and clung to it like a bat
Yet I could in no wise plant my feet firmly or climb upon the tree
for its roots spread far below and its branches hung out of reach above long and great and overshadowed Charybdis 
There I clung steadfastly until she should vomit forth mast and keel again
and to my joy they came at length
At the hour when a man rises from the assembly for his supper one that decides the many quarrels of young men that seek judgment even at that hour those spars appeared from out Charybdis 
And I let go hands and feet from above and plunged down into the waters out beyond the long spars and sitting on these I rowed onward with my hands
But as for Scylla the father of gods and men did not suffer her again to catch sight of me
else should I never have escaped utter destruction
Thence for nine days was I borne and on the tenth night the gods brought me to Ogygia where the fairtressed Calypso dwells dread goddess of human speech who gave me welcome and tendance
But why should I tell thee this tale
For it was but yesterday that I told it in thy hall to thyself and to thy noble wife
It is an irksome thing meseems to tell again a plaintold tale
